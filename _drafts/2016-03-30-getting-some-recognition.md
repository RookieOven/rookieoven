It's been a busy start to 2016 for RookieOven. The coworking space has doubled in size (16 of Glasgow finest calling RookieOven home). I've been to San Francisco checking out some of the best companies in the world (Dropbox, Facebook, Pixar, IDEO and more - read about it on the Add Jam Blog) as well as some of the coolest offices I've ever seen (toss up between Medium and Dropbox for which one was nicest). And we've been getting some amazing recognition locally and across the UK.

##The Times

The Times newspaper has launched a new supplement focused on tech called Future Scot. The first issue was out on the ##### with RookieOven featured heavily and myself listed as "top 50 pioneers of scottish tech". Not bad for a minnow like RookieOven to be rubbing shoulders with Rockstar North, Fanduel and Skyscanner.

We're really punching above our weight.

##The Scotsman

The Scotsman were in touch and keen to learn more about RookieOven.

I'm of course going to be posting my trip to the RookieOven social media (specifically [Twitter](http:/twitter.com/rookieoven), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/rookieoven) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/rookieoven)) but also my personal accounts so keep an eye on my Twitter ([@_MDHayes](http://twitter.com/_mdhayes)) or connect with me on Facebook or LinkedIn.
