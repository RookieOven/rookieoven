info_subheader: The RookieOven Story
info_paragraph: RookieOven was founded by Michael Hayes in mid 2011. Straight out of studying a Computer Science degree at University Michael had his first startup experience and... it didn't go so well. Why? Well there was no community. No network of like minded people to bounce things off. No support network of people going through the same ups and downs. Something had to be done so RookieOven started as a monthly meetup. A simple premise - grab a beer, meet fellow founders and share your experiences with each other.<br><br> Our meetups work well to connect founders across the city but Glasgow still lacked a home for the tech community and it became natural for RookieOven open up a coworking space to serve as a focal point of the Glasgow tech and startup community. Our gorgeous space in the Fairfield Shipyard Offices serves as a home for meetups, events and those looking to work day in, day out with other talented founders. RookieOven is by startup founders, for startup founders and driven froward by a passion for Glasgow to be a vibrant hub of technology and innovation.
