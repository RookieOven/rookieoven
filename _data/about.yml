subheader1: The story of RookieOven
introduction: Founded in 2011 with two aims, firstly to give Scottish startups an outlet online to promote and gain so eyeballs. Secondly, RookieOven aims to get Scotlands startup founders and enthusiasts together to share advice and knowledge.<br><br>Both the RookieOven Meetup and Blog served as a great asset for the Scottish and Glasgow tech community and was recognised by being invited to a Royal Reception in June 2014. At this Michael met some amazing people from tech communities across the UK such as Paul Smith from Campus North in Newcastle and Doug Ward from SpaceportX in Manchester. This solidified the need for such a space in Glasgow which led to the opening of the RookieOven coworking space in early 2015.<br><br>The coworking space is in the Fairfield Shipyard Offices in Govan. Once the largest shipyard on the Clyde and known around the world as a centre of engineering excellence. The space has capacity for 40 people, a dedicated events space and amazing meeting rooms.
