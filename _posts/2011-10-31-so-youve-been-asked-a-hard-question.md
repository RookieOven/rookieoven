A few weeks ago I wrote a post about the [inevitable hard questions][1] startups will have to face. I feel it&#8217;s a very important subject and the post was quite timely as I posted it shortly after a pitch event as part of Social Media Week Glasgow where I watched [Finbarr Taylor][2] and [Jamie McHale][3] pitch their startup ideas. After pitching both guys were bombarded with these &#8216;hard questions&#8217; and seeing first hand the way the guys dealt with the questions and used them to adapt their idea&#8217;s and their approach to the product I felt it was important to share that experience.

In the weeks following I&#8217;ve spoken quite a bit about idea generation and development with a few people but one discussion in particular really stood out as it was with the man pitching in the competition himself, Finbarr. Here is what Finbarr had to say:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Finbarr-on-Idea-Generation.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364" title="Finbarr on Idea Generation" src="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Finbarr-on-Idea-Generation.png" alt="Finbarr on Idea Generation" width="541" height="284" /></a>
</p>

As simple as that sounds it can be difficult to follow. If you&#8217;re passionate about your idea or product it&#8217;s far too easy to jump in and sound off. Let the person speak their mind, their worries or questions will not be unique other people (i.e. your customers) will likely have the exact same problem. Be patient, respectful and when it comes to giving a response firstly be grateful for the insight and be prepared to accept that problems exist with your idea or product.

I also think it&#8217;s important to point out that if you&#8217;re listen to a pitch or about an idea be brutally honest. It&#8217;s true ideas are fragile but if you hear an idea and you think it&#8217;s a bit rubbish be honest. Be honest but also give reason, in my eyes it&#8217;s the most helpful thing you can do.
