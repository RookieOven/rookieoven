RookieOven has been pretty quite of late, apologies for that, but I do hope to explain the reasons behind that in a post later this week but from here forward I hope for RookieOven to return to providing regular commentary, advice and shout outs to the Scottish startup community. Oh and of course the regular meetup; speaking of which&#8230;

[<img title="vespbar" alt="Vespbar Glasgow Venue for RookieOven Meetup" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/vespbar.png" width="620" height="199" />][1]

The RookieOven Meetup will be running as usual on the first Monday of May (which will be the 6th) after a hiatus over Easter. The RookieOven Meetup once again will be in Vespbar which is a short walk from either Glasgow Central or Queen Street Station. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre. We will be in the upstairs section but any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_1][2]) or the [RookieOven twitter][3] account.

The meetup is a platform for the Scottish startup community to interact on a regular basis. At the meetup there are no talks, presentations or set agendas just great conversations between Scottish startup founders, employees and enthusiasts. There are only two rules for the meetup:

  * **No sales:** this isn’t an opportunity to sell to startups
  * **No stealth mode:** Talk! Share your idea’s and experiences with fellow Scottish startups

This month I hope to see a good crowd of people passionate about tech in Scotland. If that&#8217;s you then come along and grab a beer. After all what better way to kick the month off than to come together with your peers for a few drinks?
