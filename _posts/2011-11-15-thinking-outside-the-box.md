Almost all tech startups I hear about are software based. It makes sense; margins in hardware are brutal and as Marc Andreessen pointed out, in his Wall Street Journal article [&#8220;Software is eating the world&#8221;][1], most of todays most successful/largest companies have made their success through software. So you would be mad to consider making hardware right?

I say why not? Arduino makes it easy to jump into hardware and prototype some ideas. Arduino is low cost, has a cross platform IDE and the syntax is C/C++. There is a fantastic community and countless cool [Arduino hacks][2] out there, some of them are [simply amazing][3]. Adding to the appeal of Arduino is the [Android@Home][4] framework by Google which aims to automate areas of the household in conjunction with the Android platform.
