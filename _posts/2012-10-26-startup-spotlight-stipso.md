Each Friday the RookieOven Startup Spotlight highlights a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on Scotland’s best startups from across the country. It’s an opportunity to share information about an exciting tech startup from Scotland you may not have heard of. Giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. This week the spotlight falls on Edinburgh based Stipso.

Stipso is all about Market Engagement. Specifically using market research to co-create content. Along the lines of using an infographic as a visual blog. The Stipso team comprise Steven Drost, CEO, Brian Corcoran, VP Sales, Yaniv Mazor, VP Marketing, and David Farquhar, Exec Chairman.

Stipso was initially funded by two of the founders, but they are currently putting together a round with European and US Smart Angels and Scottish Enterprise.

Stipso allow companies to build ‘live’ infographics that not only display data, but customers to collect data, too. This approach differs from traditional surveys as the ones available through Stipso are visual, exciting and social, not just computerised versions of paper questionnaires put behind a screen. These ‘live’ infographics are also constantly updating as users interact with them, contributing data. Below is an example of a Stipso powered infographic:

The founders have a professional background in market research and online marketing. Stipso was started based on their inside knowledge of (and frustration with) the online data collection and surveys world of market research. We are solving a well-known problem in the industry: respondent motivation. This is a big problem in a big industry. By solving this problem, Stipso are bringing online research into the Web 2.0 world: strong UX focus, social sharing, content creation and inbound marketing via strong Calls To Action.

The team are currently developing Stipso into a SaaS offering, letting customers set up their own data gathering infographics, and dashboards allowing them to monitor data and sharing metrics.
