A few week ago Rand Fishkin of SEOMoz gave a presentation at a Hackers and Founders event in Silicon Valley. The aim of Rands presentation was to share some tips on how to get the most mythical of things for your startup &#8211; &#8220;traction&#8221;.

The presentation is well worth a watch but it does run to 80 odd minutes so if you&#8217;re pressed for time there the slides are on [SlideShare][1] to skim through although I highly recommend watching the video.

If you skipped the video or the slides and jumped to here (spoiler alert) Rand does a great job of showing how important inbound marketing is to a startup; especially in regards to getting traction and growth.  So its great that Edinburgh University are hosting [&#8220;Entrepreneurial Inbound Marketing&#8221;][2] on the 11th of January next year. The main attraction of the day is [Bill Aulet][3], Managing Director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, who will explore inbound marketing with his talk titled &#8220;Listening to the voice of the customer&#8221;.

Others speakers include Andrew Girdwood of of BigMouthMedia and Maz Nadjmof TSL Education. Regular tickets are priced at £89.00 but there are a range of options including a discounted early bird ticket. The [Eventbrite page][2] has a ton of information and of course is where you can pick up your ticket.

Looks to be yet another quality event being organised by Edinburgh University, will you be going?
