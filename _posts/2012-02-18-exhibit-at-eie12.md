I thoroughly enjoyed EIE11 which was yet another one of the quality events put on by Informatics Ventures, in fact one of the first posts I put up on RookieOven was to highlight some of the startups that caught my eye at [Engage Invest Exploit (EIE11)][1]. By a long way it&#8217;s one of the best events for tech startups in Scotland and the good news is EIE is back for 2012 and will be taking place on the 10th May.

[Applications are open for exhibitors][2] and I would encourage every startup to apply. Not only do you get excellent exposure to investors and press on the day but in the lead up to EIE Informatics Ventures have various training workshops and seminars for exhibitors. Exhibiting also allows you to meet fellow startups from across Scotland.

The benefits above aren&#8217;t even the main reason to attend, the real reason is the keynote speaker &#8211; none other than 3 time World Drivers&#8217; Champion Sir Jackie Stewart. I personally can&#8217;t think of a better keynote speaker, a patriotic Scot who fought adversity (being an undiagnosed dyslexic) to become world champion of one of the most dangerous sports in the world. He campaigned tirelessly to improve safety standard in motorsport and become a successful businessman running the Stewart team in the late 90&#8242;s. If listening to this man can&#8217;t inspire you I don&#8217;t know what will.
