Just over a week to go until the Turing Festival 2012 so I thought I would round up some more events which I think are essential for Scottish tech startups. Some events have an entrance fee although many of the events across the Festival are free to attend.

**Startup Pitch Clinic**

Startup pitch clinic is taking place on the afternoon of the first day of the Turing Festival. All too often, tech entrepreneurs get out-dated advice on &#8220;how to pitch&#8221;, &#8220;what investors need&#8221; etc. Turing&#8217;s Startup Pitch Clinic will provide hands on lessons from someone who actually knows what they are talking about. Brian Caulfield is former tech entrepreneur who now sits on the other side of the table as an investor. He is leading the session and going to be helping Scottish startups get their investment pitch sharp.

Ticket Price: Free

On the second day of the Turing Festival David Farquhar and Mike Kennedy from Northface Ventures will host this open debate. The aim of this session is to discuss how can lean principles be applied to the role of Product Management in enterprise class software development.

As well as these great events there is also the headline act on the opening day of the Festival, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. There is a [great competition][6] where you can win free tickets to the talk, all you have to do is submit a questions you would like to ask Woz and RT the link to enter.

Personally, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the Turing Festival and hope to attend as many sessions as possible. What will you be going to? Have I missed something out?
