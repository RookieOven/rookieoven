Earlier this year we ran our first RookieOven Academy. It ran for 5 weeks (across 6, 2 hour sessions) from May into June with talented and ambitious young people from across Glasgow learning from some of the brightest minds in the Scottish startup community such as Cally Russell, Ashley Baxter and Graeme McGowan. Participants, all aged between 16-18, came up with their own business concepts and developed them into valid products that they pitched to a real investor.

We're now opening up applications for our second Academy which will run from the 8th of November until the 13th of December.

##The details
Each Tuesday evening from 6pm - 8pm participants will come along and over the course of the Academy develop a product idea. The 6 sessions are broken down as follows:

* Creative Thinking - we'll get to know each other, have a think of some real world problems and come up with product ideas to solve them
* Business Models - now we have an idea how can we make it into a sustainable business
* Identity - we need to develop an identity and product vision for our company
* Digital Marketing - using the tools of today how can we market our solution
* How to Pitch - we need to know how to communicate our idea effectively
* Demo Day - pitch to our panel of experts and investors

The Academy is completely free and open to anyone aged 16-18 to take part.

##Don't take my word for it
I believe Scottish education is often teaching the wrong thing badly however the local tech ecosystem consistently punches above its weight and produces world class products and services. This community can play an important role in helping the next generation fulfil their potential.

In our first Academy we succeeded in giving young people an insight into tech startups and creating modern businesses. “The RookieOven Academy was a fantastic opportunity to get to grips with how a tech start-up works,” said winner Selina Gourlay. “This experience has been invaluable in showing what it takes to become a successful digital entrepreneur. I really hope that one day I can turn an idea like this into reality.”

Our first Academy was a great success and we're taking a lot of learnings into this second Academy so it can only get better.

##Get involved
With the RookieOven Academy we're not looking for academic achievers. We want young people with a natural talent, that relish a challenge and have a passion for tech, design and innovation. Real passion will shine through on your application and will impress us more than straight A's.

Sound like you fit the bill? Get moving. Places are limited (we have space for only 16 of the most impressive young people in Glasgow) and applications are [open now](https://rookieoven.com/academy). The form is really short, really simple and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete.

All those accepted will have to commit to participating fully in the academy and will need availability from the 8th of November until the 13th of December and able to come to the RookieOven Coworking Space in Govan.
