I think it’s time we talk about Pokemon Go or as I like to see it as "dreams coming true for every.single.90’s.kid". It is hard to contain my excitement for our next event, [Pokemon Go Trail](https://www.facebook.com/events/1711958802358120/), which is a way for tech companies within Scotland to get together, network, support a charity, AND embrace their inner child with Pokemon Go.

##Nostalgia at it's best:

I genuinely can't help hearing the first few notes of the theme song and breaking out into...

“I WANNA BE the very best, like no one ever was! To catch them is my real test, to train them is my causssseeeeee. I will travel across the land, searching far and WIDE, teach Pokemon to understand, THE POWER THAT’S INSIDE!"

I'm sorry I can't it's just when I hear it...

"POKEMON! GOTTA CATCH ‘EM ALLLLLLLLLLLL! It’s you and me, I know it’s my DestINY, POKEMON! OHHHHH you’re my best friend, in a world we must defend, POKEMON, GOTTA CATCH ‘EM ALL!”

## #trainerstyle
I remember being a tween, with my chocker necklace on, bright blue eyeshadow, bell-bottom jeans, oversized tye-dye shirt, worried about my Tamagotchis (gotta feed that b*tch!) and playing my Gameboy feeling like the coolest kid on the block. I adored everything of my generation, but Pokemon blew them all out of the park.

I grew up in the States, so my childhood gems might be different from others but it doesn’t change the simple truth that Pokemon has brought all generations together. Looking back, I remember geeking out over the trading cards, I was on top of the world playing the Nintendo games and every single weekend I’d run over to my neighbour’s house in the mornings to watch the 3 hour Pokemon marathons. I even remember the first Pokemon I ever won from my brother – Cubone.

##Pokemon Obsessed:

To this day he is still my favourite and the moment I caught him via Pokemon Go, I felt all those memories rush back.  I am a real Pokemon Trainer.

_And I’m not alone!!_

Pokemon Go has influenced all generations, not just us 90’s kids. I truly believe it’s a wonderful and groundbreaking app which has brought joy to many individuals. Which is why Digital Media and RookieOven decided the Glasgow Tech Scene needed a Pokemon Go Trail.

##Pokemon Go Trail Event:

This weekend, August 14th, we invite you to come join us as we divide into teams and compete while drinking, eating, supporting a good cause, and catching Pokemon.

The event starts at our studio, RookieOven, and the trail continues throughout Glasgow till we ultimately end at WEST Brewery for final drinks and prizes! The goal is to have fun while also supporting the Macmillan Cancer Support.

If you're an individual or a big group, you are all welcome to come! We also highly recommend grabbing your best sneakers and gloves because there will be prizes for the best dressed and best team!

Oh yeah, it's FREE! Simply RSVP and turn up at 12:00 PM.

##Last Tips & Naysayers:

Here are some tips for the evening:

* We will be walking a lot so we recommend wearing comfy shoes.
* Highly recommend bringing your portable chargers as a backup for your Pokedex.
* Water is always a smart choice.
* #trainerstyle is not a must but totally gives you points (ehem PRIZES!).

I know there will be some naysayers out there but here are my thoughts on that: Who could actually have a bad time catching imaginary monsters while eating and drinking copious amounts of alcohol and vittles? WHO? TELL ME! I will find them, take them to find Pikachu, and if they don’t feel like the best damned Pokemon Trainer there ever was then I’m probably just secretly part of Team Rocket.

I can't wait to see everyone on the 14th and you better believe we're going to catch them all! Check out more details via the [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1711958802358120/)!

Be there or be a Derpy Lamasaur!
