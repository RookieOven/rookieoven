In Scotland? Into UX? Well you&#8217;re in luck as [UX Scotland][1] is just round the corner and what&#8217;s more you can get all your news about [U][1]X Scotland here!

I&#8217;m happy to announce that RookieOven will be the official bloggers at this year&#8217;s UX Scotland conference. The event is taking place over two days at the Dynamic Earth centre in Edinburgh on 20 and 21 June.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11011" alt="UX Scotland" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/UX-Scotland1.png" width="500" height="125" />

We&#8217;re looking forward to reporting at UX Scotland and finding out what the latest developments are in user experience design. The conference will be keeping things practical. It&#8217;s a UX event after all! Come along to meet designers and others who are interested in UX and learn how to design better user experiences. And feel free to say hello if you&#8217;re there and want to have a chat &#8211; hunt me down on Twitter ([@daviddobleve][2]).

The keynote speakers are [Jeff Gothelf][3] and [Giles Colborne][4]. Full details of other speakers and workshops will be published soon so stay tuned.
