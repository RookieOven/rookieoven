Yes, ShopForCloud has been acquired by RightScale, the cloud computing management solution. As part of the acquisition ShopForCloud has now been rebranded as [PlanForCloud][1].

PlanForCloud makes it easy to budget future cloud costs by providing a set of tools to model deployments and usage patterns and then automatically calculate costs across a variety of clouds. PlanForCloud currently includes support for a range of cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace and Microsoft Windows Azure with more clouds coming soon.

PlanForCloud will continue to operate in Edinburgh, in the new TechCube working space, and the tool will be kept free of charge to everyone with co-founder Hassan saying &#8220;It is fantastic that RightScale has given us the flexibility to setup office in Edinburgh and enabled us to keep providing great new features for free&#8221;.

Users of ShopForCloud can use their username and password on PlanForCloud. As part of this they have a new new [Privacy Policy][3] and [Terms of Service][4]; the guys have been open about this and are allowing users to opt-out of the transition to PlanForCloud.

Congratulations to both Hassan and Ali.
