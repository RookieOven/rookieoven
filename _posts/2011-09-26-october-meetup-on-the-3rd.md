The meetup will be as usual in Bier Halle Hippo Lounge on Sauchiehall Street Glasgow from half 6 onwards.

September has been a busy month in tech for a start there is the whole Techcrunch, Arrington, Uncrunch, Paul Carr, AOL saga/tiff. Closer to home there was good news for Edinburgh based [FanDuel][2] with a $4 Million series B investment, more funding and users for Glasgow based [Kiltr][3], the long awaited beta launch of [Social Enhancer][4] by Clarke Duncan and Glasgow based [Moviecom.tv][5] launched a new &#8216;GoPro&#8217; version as you can see in this brilliant new video:

In the middle of September [Startup Britain came to Scotland][6], from this we will hopefully see some steps forward to creating further support and help for startups in Scotland. Another visitor to Scotland in September was Social Media Week, as part of Social Media Week major tech companies such as Google and Nokia came to the city. As part of Social Media Week there was also a pitch event organised by [Daniela Castrataro][7] with two top talents form Glasgow going up against startups from German and Italy. Jamie McHale presented [seeu.at ][8]with the aim of solving the problems of arranging real world social gatherings and [Finbarr Taylor][9] presented a modern solution to using the boring old password for authenication called Vauthen.

Been a busy month so I&#8217;m looking forward to catching up with everyone on the 3rd. All welcome no invite required just turn up anytime after half 6 although would advise coming sharpish because if you&#8217;re a bit late you&#8217;ll miss out on the free pizza.
