Generating interest, getting feedback and building a community are all essentials for most startups. Blogging is a key way of hitting all those bases and starting to build connections. Just look at Rookie Oven!

WordPress is a very popular tool for blogging. It is a great content management system that helps you get up and running quickly.

Here are five points as to why WordPress might be suitable for your startup blog:

**1. Quick Install**

The famous &#8216;Five minute install&#8217; is usually painless. Many web hosts offer 1-click installs of WordPress.

**2. Customisability**

WordPress is highly extensible. You can customise the look, feel and functionality of your blog. This makes WordPress a great choice for those who don&#8217;t know how their blog will develop. If you are worried about choosing a platform that will support future technologies then WordPress should be a safe bet.

**3. Your content is yours**

WordPress makes it easy to export content. Other paid providers may make it difficult to export data. Your content is yours when you have a WordPress site.

**4. Easily share content with plugins**

There are many great plugins that are available to use on your site that allow you to share content. From Twitter, Facebook and Google +1 buttons through to commenting plugins such as Disqus, MailChimp Social and IntenseDebate.

Sharing content means you are more likely to get the feedback, ideas and community that you need.

**5. Great developer community**

If you are stuck with WordPress there is a great developer community on [WordPress.org][3]. Closer to home there is the [WPScotland][4] group.

**What tools do you use to build your websites and blogs? What other packages are good for those starting a company blog**?
