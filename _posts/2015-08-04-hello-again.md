Hello and welcome back to the RookieOven blog. Been quite on here for almost a year. Apologies for that but I do have two very good reasons. Firstly I've been head down with my startup [Add Jam](https://addjam.com) where I work alongside Chris Sloey and make products and take on client projects, such as my work on the Future City Project in Glasgow. Secondly I've been working on opening the fantastic RookieOven Coworking space in Govan.

##A home for the community

Last June I [wrote a post](http://rookieoven.com/2014/06/18/where-is-the-heart-of-the-glasgow-tech-community/) asking where the heart of the Glasgow tech community is. We see Edinburgh with both Codebase and TechCube doign great things for the startup community over in the east. They serve as a central focal point and offer reliable, repeatable space for meetups and other events. Glasgow was lacking this.

I use the past tense there because I think we now have this in the RookieOven Space.
