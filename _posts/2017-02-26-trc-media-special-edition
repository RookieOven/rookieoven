TRC Media acknowledge that women are under-represented at board level in the tech/digital sector in Scotland - so they decided to take action. Special Edition is an initiative that aims to help women reach their full potential in the industry. The six-month programme offers participants a chance to learn from detailed workshops and develop not only their professional and creative skills, but their entrepreneurial and networking skills.

Previous candidates have gone on to secure boardroom level positions and even start their own companies. The ambition of the program is ultimately to have all female participants embarking on a career which leads to the boardroom.

TRC Media run the excellent Cross Creative and Special Edition programmes for tech companies in Scotland and do a great job providing world class training and development for tech talent in Scotland.

##What will the programme involve?
During the six months candidates will receive help developing their skills through formal training workshops taught by top mentors. The workshops aim to boost the candidate's confidence and help build their professional network as Special Edition is a great opportunity to meet other women with similar ambition in the tech sector.

Entrepreneurial skills will also be developed throughout the programme as candidates learn how to progress their current careers in the digital sector. The programme involves an international trip to experience many digital centres of excellence where participants will meet the industry's most influential leaders and innovators.

The skills and training are tailored to the individuals in the programme and previously discussed themes have been:

  * Personal and professional goal setting
  * Influencing skills
  * Creative thinking and problem solving
  * Entrepreneurship
  * Management techniques
  * Networking

2016's Special Edition started back in August beginning the first of the five sessions which ended in a very successful international trip.

##What is the entry criteria?
Special Edition was created for women working in the digital sector - specifically those who work in commercial creative businesses. This includes businesses such as digital design, agencies, games, animation, mobile apps, publishing, augmented/virtual reality, technology and platforms/software.

Those who wish to apply should ideally have:

* Significant experience in their field
* Experience in management
* The aim of reaching Boardroom/Director level or run their own business.

There are limited places available on Special Edition and the highly competitive selection process is based on talent, need and clearly articulated goals.
