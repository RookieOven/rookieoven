A lot of people are shocked to discover I've never been to San Francisco (in fact the last time I was even in America I was on a school trip at 13) but that's about to change. On Saturday I head over to California as part of the 2016 Cross Creative Programme with my Add Jam hat on. However I see an opportunity to help spread the word about the great businesses based in Scotland - I want you to dress me.

While in California I'm going to be visiting companies like Twitter, Facebook, IDEO, Dropbox, Unity and Pixar so why don't I wear branded tshirts and/or hoodies from Scottish startups?

I know it's pretty short notice but if anyone has tshirts or swag thy would like me to model in California drop me an email (michael@rookieoven.com) and I can arrange to pick it up from you.

I'm of course going to be posting my trip to the RookieOven social media (specifically [Twitter](http:/twitter.com/rookieoven), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/rookieoven) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/rookieoven)) but also my personal accounts so keep an eye on my Twitter ([@_MDHayes](http://twitter.com/_mdhayes)) or connect with me on Facebook or LinkedIn.
