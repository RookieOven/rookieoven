Growing a startup quickly can be difficult. Maintaining momentum, taking care of customer relationships, and working on your product can easily become overwhelming.

At Seeu.at I&#8217;m now at the stage where I need a little extra help &#8211; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m now looking for [two marketing intern positions][1].  
I want to ensure that the interns have the best experience possible and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m setting out the following:

  * **Interns will have specific defined projects** &#8211; they won&#8217;t be assigned &#8216;filler&#8217; odd-jobs.
  * **Interns will be part of the team** &#8211; they will be able to contribute to the planning of their projects, taking responsibility, and developing their skill set. This includes all the training and learning facilities we have access to at [Entrepreneurial Spark][2].
  * **Interns will become our first product evangelists**. I want the interns to have a great experience working with Seeu.at, so whenever they move on (or if they become more involved in the future) they will shout about Seeu.at from the rooftops. It&#8217;s important that everyone that comes into contact with the company catches the positive entrepreneurial spirit &#8211; and the interns will be on the front-line.

If you know anyone who wants to get involved with an early stage tech startup then direct them to the [marketing interns recruitment post][1] on the Seeu.at blog. If they aren&#8217;t marketers but want to offer up another skill set, then I&#8217;d love to hear from them too.

Taking on interns can be a good move to help build your team at an early stage and also help foster the local entrepreneurial community, do you agree?
