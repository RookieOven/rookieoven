Now obviously the big draw is the headline act, Steve Wozniak on the 23rd of August, but from 9-12 on the 23rd is [Aligning Interests][2] being organised by Brian Corcoran of Stipso.

  <p>
    One of the aims of Turing is help develop the considerable latent potential of the Scottish startup ecosystem. To that end this event is bringing together an international panel of preeminent folk from both sides of the table to discuss both the general question of what makes a great startup ecosystem, as well as specifically looking at the issue of Scotland&#8217;s critical lack of seed funding for tech startups & how to remedy it. Participating from the floor will be members of Scotland&#8217;s investment community as well as the country&#8217;s best technology entrepreneurs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The panel will be made up of:
