<img class="alignright" title="Startup Digest" src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0520/70520v6-max-250x250.jpg" alt="The Startup Digest" width="250" height="45" />The Startup Digest is a weekly email detailing the best events from various areas around the world to over 250,000 subscribers. The Scottish version of The Startup Digest was started in the summer of this year by Christopher McCann but due to a change in career Chris has now passed the reins of being curator to someone else&#8230; me!

There are so many great events happening across Scotland but it can be difficult finding out about them, a perfect example would be the Turing Festival that happened at the end of August. There were a host of internationally [renowned speakers][1] at the festival however I sadly missed out as it wasn&#8217;t on my radar. From this Monday onwards you will get a weekly email highlighting the best events for startups across Scotland for the coming week and all you have to do is subscribe for free. Subscription is easy on [The Startup Digest signup page][2] selecting Scotland as your area (would also be worth your time subscribing to the London Digest curated by Scott Allison).

To make the Scottish Startup Digest a success I&#8217;m going to need your help. Please email me by the Sunday before the event at <mdhayes@thestartupdigest.com> with any events happening in Scotland that you feel are startup relevant.

Will be doing my first Digest this weekend so get signed up and let me know whats happening.
