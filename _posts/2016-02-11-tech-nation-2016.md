Tech City, the London-based publicly funded, non-profit team focusing on creating the optimum conditions for digital technology businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive across the UK, has launched the 2016 Tech Nation report.

Tech Nation provides an overview of the UK tech industry. The research sheds light on the depth and breadth of the Digital Tech Economy across the UK, including Glasgow.

Glasgow was profiled by the Tech City team last year with Emma Swift, Senior Entrepreneur Relations Manager, paying Glasgow a visit in November. Thanks to input from across the Glasgow tech industry the Tech City team have been able to highlight the many assets our city has. The 2016 Tech Nation report shows our contribution to the UK industry as a whole and profiles local companies such as Adimo and Axis Animation.

You get get a copy of the report from [Tech Nation 2016 homepage](http://techcityuk.com/technation/) and I've included an infographic below with the findings of the report for Glasgow. The outcomes are encouraging. Particularly pleased to see our output of graduate talent highlighted as a strength, a great average salary (Â£46,864) and good growth in employment (13%).
