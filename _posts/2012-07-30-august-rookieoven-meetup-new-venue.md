Next meetup will be taking place on the 6th of August, starting at the usual time of half 6 and with the new venue being one of Glasgow&#8217;s newest bars, Vespbar on Drury Street Glasgow

Vespbar is a short walk from Glasgow Central Station or Queen Street Station and have quickly become a popular location to hold a meetup with both Refresh Glasgow and the Glasgow UX Book Club calling Vespbar home of late. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre, yip the freaking metre. Any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_1][1]) or the [RookieOven twitter][2] account.

With the new venue I want to introduce something a little different. I would encourage any startup/individual attending to email me a single slide (in .ppt, .pdf or .key) describing what they do, who they are or who they would like to meet. The last meetup was the busiest yet with over 40 people in attendance, so to allow everyone to know who else is in the room it seems a a simple and unobtrusive solution. Whilst up to the startup/individual what they include on the slide I reckon it  shouldn&#8217;t be loaded full of content; I&#8217;m thinking something along the lines of this:

<div id="attachment_891" style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/code-created-me-deck.png"><img class=" wp-image-891 " title="code-created-me-deck" src="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/code-created-me-deck.png" alt="CodeCreatedMe Slide" width="556" height="417" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

I will have a rolling slideshow with all the slides I receive (well the ones that are suitable to display) so all the attendees can easily discern who else is attending. Sound like a good idea? Would love some feedback on it, please leave a comment or drop [me an email][3].

As always the meetup is free to attend, no need to sign up or get a ticket. Just turn up, grab a beer and chat with your peers. See you there on Monday 6th?
