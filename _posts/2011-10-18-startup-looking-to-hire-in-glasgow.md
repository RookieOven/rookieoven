[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-350" title="twig-logo" src="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/twig-logo.png" alt="Twig Logo" width="73" height="100" />][1][Kevin Brolly][2], who many of you may know from the RookieOven meetups, is currently working as a web developer at video based education startup [Twig][3]. Kevin got in touch to say Twig are looking to expand the development team. Specifically Kevin is looking for both a front end and a back end developer with the talent, attitude and right personality to join his development team based in Glasgow.

Twig describe themselves as a &#8220;Dynamic Teaching Resource&#8221; and provide over 500 high quality short clips to teachers at KS2, KS3 and GCSE levels. From my experience at dizeo.com, education startups are a lot of fun and throw up a lot of unique challenges so would be an interesting team to join.

The Twig website is undergoing redevelopment and expansion and the developers will need to be skilled in the usual web standards and requirements of such roles. Twig are looking for the back end developer to be skilled in Python and Django and Kevin also says experience with AWS and Git would be a bonus. That you? Email Rachel Taylor (<rtaylor@twig-it.com>) with a CV, covering letter and any relevant links you may have about the web (GitHub, StackOverflow etc).

If you have a passion for startups but aren&#8217;t in a position to start your own this could be the ideal opportunity. As I said education startups are great fun with some unique challenges and problems.

*Feel I should just declare I&#8217;m receiving no payment for this post from either Kevin or Twig. Just raising awareness of a Scottish startup looking for talent.*
