The first ever Scottish Startup Weekend took place in Glasgow on the 25-27th May 2012. The challenge was for entrepreneurs, designers and developers to build and launch a tech startup in just 54 hours.

Starting on the Friday evening 24 people pitched their ideas and after frantic voting, 11 ideas were selected for the weekend. All the attendees then adopted themselves into a team and started trying to ignore the rarely seen Scottish sunny weather to get developing.

The 11 teams were:

  * **Gifty**: your friends, the perfect gifts. The best way of taking guess work out of buying gifts for your close ones: <http://join.giftyapp.co.uk/>   @gifty_app
