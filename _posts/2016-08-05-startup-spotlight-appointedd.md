Each Friday the RookieOven Startup Spotlight highlights a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on Scotland’s best startups from across the country. It’s an opportunity to share information about an exciting tech startup from Scotland you may not have heard of. Giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. This week the spotlight falls on Appointedd.

##Appointing you in the right direction:

Bad pun aside, we’ve seen companies help organize businesses before but Appointedd has it’s own special touch within the booking industry. This online booking and business management software company has taken Scotland by storm! I got an opportunity to talk with Marc Blake, Appoitedd’s Marketing Manager to discuss more about this fantastic startup.

Marc describes Appointedd as a company which “allows all kinds of different small, independent, businesses to take online bookings from their website, Facebook and really any online presence. Then once that booking is made the software can manage that booking right the way through their business. The whole business can be managed all in one place.”

##How a frustration became an inspiration:

Leah Hutcheon, CEO of Appointedd, grew incredibly frustrated that booking anything would always be a pain. As a magazine editor, Hutcheon was always on the go and used to a busy schedule which needing to manage everything online. “The only thing she couldn’t seem to book was my hairdresser appointments, or anything engaging with independent businesses. She thought if she had that problem, who else was experiencing this too.” As this frustration grew she realized that this could be something huge for companies, big or small, thus Appointedd began.


##Small but mighty:

“We are a small but [growing team](https://www.appointedd.com/about-appointedd). We had 4 team members at the start of the year and we’ve now grown to 8 in the last few months.”
