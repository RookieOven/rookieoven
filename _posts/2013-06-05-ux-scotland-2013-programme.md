UX Scotland lands in Edinburgh in two weeks&#8217; time, setting up home at the Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh over the two days from Thursday, 20 June to Friday, 21 June.  The [programme of events][1] is now up and there are some great speakers who will be taking to the stage to pass on practical advice about all things user experience.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11471" alt="UX Scotland at Dynamic Earth" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UX-Scotland-dynamic-earth1.jpg" width="500" height="156" />][2]

Each day kicks off with a keynote.  Jeff Gothelf is speaking on Wednesday about Lean UX and looking at how to get to the right solutions better, faster, stronger.  On Thursday, Giles Colborne will be talking about designing for context and giving examples of how to adapt to smartphones, tablets and other environments.

A quick spin through the UX Scotland lineup shows that UX is something that everybody from startups and the big institutions are all giving a lot of thought to.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to contrast whether the likes of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life approach UX differently from Prezi and FreeAgent.

Some of the events that have caught my eye are &#8220;[The Mind&#8217;s Eye: How We Perceive Data][3]&#8221; with Graham Odds, &#8220;[Designing &#8216;The Bottom Half of the Internet&#8217;][4]&#8221; with Martin Belam,  &#8221;[Design Just Enough][5]&#8221; with David Gauquelin and &#8220;[The Future in Designing for the Sex(es)][6]&#8221; with Cathy Wang.

UX Scotland is a great opportunity to brush up on the latest thinking and to meet the top designers, entrepreneurs and executives who care about UX.
