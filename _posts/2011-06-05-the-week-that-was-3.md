[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-62" title="week that was" src="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/week-that-was-300x123.png" alt="Week that was logo" width="240" height="98" />][1]This week was a weird one. We didn&#8217;t get a lot done product wise but I feel we&#8217;ve came a long way through several important discussions. We finalised what the product we are going to build our product around and we are calling it Visume. Visume deserves a post of it&#8217;s own which I will do in the coming days.

During the week the final ideas for [Social Innovation Camp Scotland ][2]were announced. From 17th-19th June developers and designers get together to tackle social problems. This year the theme is social isolation and the finalist can be found [here][3]. You need to apply for a place which I have done, all you need to do is pick which idea is your favourite one to work on. Looking forward to it if I get picked to go.

During the week I was through in Edinburgh again for yet another event being held out there. [Hopefully the meet up tomorrow in Glasgow][4] can be even half as good an lead to more regular events over this side of the country. Looking forward to it and the chance to meet a lot of new faces from the Glasgow Tech Scene.

It felt like the rest of my week was spent at the cinema. I do enjoy watching movies but I don&#8217;t get to the cinema too often but this week I ended up there twice to see X-Men First Class and Senna. Would highly recommend both films, Senna in particular.
