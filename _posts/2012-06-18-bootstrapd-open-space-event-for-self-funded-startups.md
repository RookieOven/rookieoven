Of interest to Scottish startups is Bootstrapd, a non-profit event for software professionals with an independent spirit. Bootstrapd is a gathering for the growing community of skilled software practitioners who are starting their own software product businesses, without external funding. The ethos of this community derives from the term bootstrapping, a self-sustaining process that proceeds without external help.

There are no keynote speakers. All sessions will be organised by the participants themselves, and the programme will be decided during the introductory session on the day. Bootstrapd is timed to coincide with the Scottish Ruby Conference, an established international event.

This full-day event takes place on Wednesday 27th June 2012 at Abden House in Edinburgh. Tickets cost £75, including lunch and refreshments throughout the day. All surplus revenue will be put behind the bar for the post-conference drinks. Bootstrapd is being organised by Matt Wynne and Steve Tooke; Matt is bootstrapping [Relish App][1], a niche product for software development teams. Steve runs Heavies, a design and development agency that aspires to move into product development.

When asked the difference between the bootstrapping community and the regualar startup community, Matt said “we don’t want VC funding, we aren’t looking for a big exit. We just want to create a sustainable lifestyle where we can enjoy building products that other people love.” That&#8217;s an outlook I agree with and I look forward to seeing what comes out of the event.
