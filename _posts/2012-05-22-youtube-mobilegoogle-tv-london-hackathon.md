I recieved an email about the YouTube Mobile/Google TV London Hackathon on 6th-8th of July and thought it would be of interest to the readers of RookieOven. YouTube and Google TV teams are hosting a VIP hackathon in London, UK at the Google offices and [The Campus][1].

If you are building Android smartphone, tablet, or Google TV Android applications and need to incorporate high-quality YouTube video playback in your product this event is for you. At this event you will learn more and have an opportunity to provide feedback about this new YouTube Android and Google TV API. To help you get the most out of this event, there will be dedicated on-site support provided by Google engineers.  Attendees are invited to build their dream app, get some cool swag, compete for best app prizes and, most importantly, have fun hacking!

There are a limited number of slots available, so if you are interested in participating RSVP as soon as possible, and no later than Friday, June 1st.** **To RSVP, please fill in [this form][2]. The event is a Google one so you need to have prior experience of developing Android apps.

So are you developing Android app with YouTube playback? Best get yourself down to London for 6th-8th July.
