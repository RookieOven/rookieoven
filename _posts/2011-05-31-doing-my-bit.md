The last few posts on here I&#8217;ve been banging on about how in Glasgow we should have a better community for tech folk so I&#8217;m not going to sit by and just moan. I&#8217;m going to act!

I want to get anyone who has an interest in the internet, technology, design, social media or being an entrepreneurÂ to meet up, grab a couple of beers and get to know each other. Quite informal, not set topics or rules just a get together for some great chat. So you interested?

I&#8217;m thinking Monday 6th June in [Republic Bier Halle ][1]on Gordon Street, Glasgow at half 6. Great beers, great pizza and better chat. Hopefully if there is a good turn out we can turn this into a monthly catch up over a few beers. Sound good?

If you&#8217;re interested leave a comment or get in touch with me via [Twitter][2].
