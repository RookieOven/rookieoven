Time equals money, apparently. But how do we value each?

When starting a tech startup it is often easy to get going on a limited budget. The tools that you use to code are free. A domain is pennies, and starter hosting can cost virtually nothing. You can make considerable progress on limited resources.

But time is a finite resource too. You have limited hours in the day and &#8220;the arrow of time moves in one direction&#8221;. Are you trading your time for money saved?

With my startup [Seeu.at][3] we&#8217;ve been able to get by on very limited resources. We built bits of the product, tested them out, spoke to potential customers and to potential users. We launched a trial version of the site &#8211; that allows people to plan nights out with their friends and find local offers. We shouted about it on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.

A trickle of users came in. Enough for us to subjectively learn what worked, and what didn&#8217;t work. Often it was fairly obvious in retrospect! But now the product is a little more refined, and we need to test with a larger volume of users in order to get a higher quality of data. We needed to start being objective about our decisions.

We can, and will, continue to build our presence on social media, blogs and with word-of-mouth marketing. But that will take time. The longer we go on, the longer we may be heading down the wrong route.

**We know what we need to learn. **

Our business model has variables for which we only have guess-timates. So I asked: &#8220;what are we waiting for?&#8221;

That&#8217;s why we launched a Facebook and Google AdWords campaign last week. The dynamic of our efforts has changed now &#8211; we know that every click costs, and optimisation is at the forefront of our minds.

Nothing focuses the mind like spending money!

But we know that time is valuable too &#8211; so why does it not provide the same personal incentive as money? It&#8217;s all to easy to justify a little more time to yourself. We are good at rationalising time spent. Particularly time developing the product!

In the long-run, it&#8217;s better to put your money where your mouth is and get the idea tested quickly. So take the plunge &#8211; set out an advertising budget. How much is finding out about your users worth to you? How much is your time worth to you? If you are serious, spend something!
