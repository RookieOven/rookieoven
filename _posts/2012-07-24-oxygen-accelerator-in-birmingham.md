Oxygen is a pre-seed accelerator programme like YCombinator and provides:

  * The 13-week acceleration phase between October and December
  * Equity investment
  * Founder of €7,500k per founder, maximum of 3 founders per team
  * Up to €6k re-location allowance
  * The total investment for the accelerator is €28,500k for 8% equity
  * Programme now includes a 13-week incubation period which starts straight after the 13-week accelerator
  * We have  introduced €12,500k of investment for the incubation phase for a further 2% of equity
  * So the total potential investment for the whole 26 weeks is €41,000 for 10% equity
  * €100,000 worth of free services are also available from companies like Rackspace and Paypal
  * Office space for the full 26 weeks

Oxygen are interested to hear form companies from a range of spaces including:

  * Ecommerce
  * Social Media
  * Mobile
  * Data Analysis
  * Publishing
  * Developer Tools
  * Video
  * Gaming
  * Education
  * SaaS

If the offering is to your taste and your startup is working in that area you can apply via the [Oxygen Accelerator][2] homepage although you&#8217;ll have to be quick. The closing date for applications is the 31st of July. If you do choose to apply best of luck to you, be great to see some Scottish companies heading down to showcase the kind of talent the local community can produce.
