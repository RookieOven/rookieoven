Scotland has a fair few startups with a presence on the Android platform such as [Gifty][1], [Zappar][2], [Poker Hands][3] and [Flexpansion][4] and in the not too distant future [Swarmly][5], [WallaBee][6] and [travelbit][7] will also have Android versions. So there&#8217;s clearly a breadth of talent in the Scottish community focusing on mobile applications, and specifically Android. That&#8217;s why I think the fourth consecutive [Droidcon][8] will be of use to many in the Scottish community.

Droidcon London, taking place 25th-26th October this year, is Europe’s largest Android event. It brings together various parts of the Android community, from talented developers to brilliant designers with the aim to discuss the best of business, design, and development on the Android platform. Droidcon also has three excellent keynote speakers for the event; they are:

  * Julie Uhrman CEO of OUYA. The first Android based gaming console that had huge success on Kickstarter earlier this year
  * Paresh Patel Founder of Vendscreen. Makers of an Andorid vending machine
  * Frederic Albinet Marketing Group Manager at Parrot makers of the AR.Drone quadricopter

Day One of the conference is &#8216;community day&#8217; with a Barcamp. This is an ‘unconference’-style day where attendees are invited to present short talks based on their professional interests. Everyone&#8217;s participation is encouraged: debates, presentations, experience sharing, are all welcome. In the evening there will be Democamp. This is an opportunity to launch and showcase the latest Android apps.

Day Two is conference day. There will be talks from industry experts alongside large Android players such as Google, Facebook, Sony, Intel, Airpush, Barnes and Nobles and many more. Talks include developing for Google TV, AI in Android apps and gaming on Android.

If you&#8217;re currently developing on Android, or are considering doing so soon, Droidcon 2012 should be beneficial to you. Will you be going?
