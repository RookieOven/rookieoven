Last week I announced [something a little different][1] for the December meetup however I&#8217;m sorry to say there is a slight change of plan and we will have to resort to the usual venue and set up for the 5th of December. This means pizza and a few beers in Bier Halle Hippo Lounge in Sauchiehall Street Glasgow.

The response to the pitch night from the local community has been excellent so it&#8217;s definitely not being cancelled, instead the event will be held on yet to be confirmed date in January as a way to kick off 2012. Moving the date back will allow more time to organise the evening and ensure its done properly to a standard the local startup community deserves. Moving back to January is also beneficial to our host, Entrepreneurial Spark. Jim Duffy is working flat-out preparing the space for the first batch of startups for the Entrepreneurial Spark opening in January. So taking place at the start of 2012 will also allow the pitch event to coincide with the launch of the Entrepreneurial Spark accelerator which will undoubtedly bring some new faces to pitch.

I would appreciate if everyone could help spread the word that the meetup will be in the usual place on Monday and accept my apologise on the late notice.

Whilst the delay means the local community won&#8217;t be saying cheerio to 2011 in the way I had hoped it does mean we can kick off 2012 with a bang. That&#8217;s not to say we won&#8217;t have fun this Monday in Hippo Lounge and I look forward to seeing everyone there.
