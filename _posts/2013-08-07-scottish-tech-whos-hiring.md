A great resource on the Hacker News community is the monthly &#8216;Who&#8217;s Hiring&#8217; thread where startups can promote openings. I figured it would be useful to do something similar for Scotland so I sent a tweet out a few days ago asking who in the Scottish tech community is hiring. The response was great and highlighted a variety of openings across the country working on some really interesting products in businesses of various sizes (some young, some mature). So here goes:
