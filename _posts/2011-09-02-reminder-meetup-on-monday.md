Monday the 5th is the first Monday of September therefore it&#8217;s meetup time! There has been a lot happening since the last meetup on the 8th of August, for me personally there was the end of [Vesume][1], there have been [massive acquisitions][2], a major [hardware manufacturer][3] turning to software, a [CEO resigned][4], the startup scene in Scotland was profiled on [TheNextWeb][5] and there has been a launch or two of local startups ([zendit][6] on the App Store and [Bon Voyage][7] for buying your next cruise).

[Kevin McCallum][8] from [FreeAgent][9], accounting software for freelancers and small businesses, will be at the meetup and will share advice and tell the FreeAgent story so far. It&#8217;s great to have Kevin coming along to share his experience, it&#8217;s exactly what the community should be about.

The meetup will be in the usual venue Bier Halle Hippo Lounge on Sauchiehall Street who from half six onwards.

All welcome, just come along anytime although if you&#8217;re a bit late I can&#8217;t guarantee that I won&#8217;t have eaten all the pizza.
