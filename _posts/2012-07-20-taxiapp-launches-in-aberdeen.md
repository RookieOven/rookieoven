There is now a new way of booking a taxi in Aberdeen. TaxiApp has been launched by Aberdeen based company Whaapp.  The app is available from today in the [App Store][1] and enables users to instantly book a taxi through their smart phone for immediate or future travel requirements.

Taxiapp, is a GPS based taxi booking service that will alert ComCab, who will fulfill the taxi pick-up service in Aberdeen, to accept the fare and collect the customer. Craig Angus, CEO, says: “It’s a very exciting day for the entire Whaapp team and the people who have helped us to reach this milestone. It’s been almost a year in the making and to finally be able to see the app in action will be a great moment for us”.

TaxiApp is initially available on iPhone, iPad and iPod, with future versions planned for Android and Blackberry devices. Whaapp Limited was established by Craig Angus, Eleanor Powell-Jackson and Craig Burnett, in 2011 to develop web and smart phone based multimedia applications.

Good to see a startup from outside the central belt emerging and launching their product. Will be keeping an eye on the guys and wish them every success.
