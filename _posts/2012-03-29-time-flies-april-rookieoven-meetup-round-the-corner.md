Time really is flying in 2012, almost at April already!! The good news with a new month is that it means another [RookieOven meetup][1]. As usual taking place in the Bier Halle Hippo Lounge (on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow) on the first Monday of the month from half 6 onwards there will be free pizza to help fuel the startup talk.

March has been a busy month so there will be been plenty to catch up with. Firstly the announcement of Startup Weekend Glasgow which will be taking place over the weekend of [25th-27th May][2]. Come along with business idea, pitch on the Friday night, form a team and build an awesome product. [Early bird tickets are now on sale][3] and costing £30 which covers the cost of all our meals over the weekend and a constant supply of caffeine to keep you coding through the night. I&#8217;m part of the team organising Startup Weekend so will be able to answer any burning questions on Monday.

Also in March we had a few product launches and new releases, one of which we can give a whirl on Monday with the BeerDog from Zendit. Allowing you to share your beer finds with friends, The BeerDog should be the perfect companion for the meetup on Monday.

RookieOven itself had an eventful month even with a new contributor, David Wong of Plantedd, sharing what he feel should be in [a great startup logo][4] and RookieOven attended the London Web Summit with Jamie McHale going down to check things out.

So what have you been getting up to this month? Look forward to finding out on the 2nd.
