This week kicked off with me, Chris and Finbarr going along to #PoolTweetUp2 on Monday. The event was organised by [Allan Barr][1] of TheBIGPartnership and I truly embarrassed myself when I started setting up a game of pool when there was already a tense game going on&#8230; oops. I but the blame on [Kev Oneil][2] from Moviecom.tv, everyone knows if you shake hands at near a pool table its cos its game over. It was good fun and I hope Allan will set up a #PoolTweetup3.

The rest of the week involved me and the guys pressing ahead with making Vesume. There was a recently announced product that came out of a startup weekend in Canada that is very very similar to what we are doing. This won&#8217;t put us off and I will be doing a post in the coming weeks to elaborate on why. Suffice to say its made us more determined to make an amazing product that will blow them out the water.

The other stand out for the past week was [#themeet140][3] on Thursday night. Aside from being in the hardest to find bar in Glasgow it was a great night. It was my first time along to #themeet140 and I didn&#8217;t quite know what to expect but it was brilliant to put faces to @names and there was a nice relaxed atmosphere that you don&#8217;t always get a tweetups. There was also a an excellent mix of people, from the young to the not quite as young and all from a range of professions. As good as it was it was nowhere near as good as the RookieOven meetup with the next one coming up on the 4th of July. Looking forward to seeing the guys who came along to the first meetup but also hope to see some new faces. Would appreciate if everyone can spread the word and get more folk along, its not a night just for developers. Would love to see people with a passion for tech and startups even if its just a hobby for now.

So lets get the word out, 4th July at half 6 in Bier Halle Gordon Street, using the hashtag [#ROtweetup][4].
