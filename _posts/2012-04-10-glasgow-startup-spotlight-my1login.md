At London Web Summit I met up with [My1Login][2], a Glasgow startup who aim to change the way we store and use our online passwords. Having secured £250,000 in funding they are taking the service worldwide.

The website allows users to securely store usernames and strong passwords in the My1Login online vault. They can then get 1-click access to these sites easily through the web-based interface. The passwords are encrypted, so not even My1Login has access to your data.

My1Login are based in an incubator space in the West End of Glasgow, provided by [Digital Enterprise Glasgow][3], who are funded by Glasgow City Council. Their £250k in funding has been raised from Scottish Enterprise. You can find them at [www.my1login.com][4] and [@my1login][5].

It&#8217;s great to see Scottish tech startups doing well!
