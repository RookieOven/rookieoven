As part of Social Media Week Glasgow there is going to be an interesting event along with two of the other European host cities, Berlin and Milan. In it two early stage tech startups from each city will compete by pitching their idea to a panel of judges. So thats 6 startups, 3 cities form across Europe and a global stage for some talented individuals to pitch their ideas.

The event is a competition with the winner being decided jointly by the judges and the audience so come along and get voting to help out our local startups. To attend you need to register but all the details can be found [here on the Social Media Week Glasgow page][2]. It&#8217;s free to attend and I reckon we could use it as an excuse to visit the pub afterwards.

It will give Glasgow a chance to show the world we have the talent and ambition to compete with the best in the world in the tech space. Look forward to seeing you there or if not seeing your tweets on the [#smwEUstartupchallenge][3] hashtag.
