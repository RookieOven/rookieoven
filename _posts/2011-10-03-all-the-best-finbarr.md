This is just a short post to wish all the best to Mr. Finbarr Taylor. If you&#8217;ve read a few of my previous blog posts or been to one of the RookieOven meetups in Glasgow you will have came across Finbarr. Finbarr and I studied Computer Science together at Strathclyde University and over the last few months have been working together on a few projects, such as the stillborn [Vesume][1].

Whilst the Vesume venture didn&#8217;t pan out as we had hoped Finbarr is today starting a new exciting venture as he moves 5000 miles away to California. Finbarr is one hell of a talented guy and an amazing software engineer and I will not be surprised when I see him as a leading CEO or CTO in the years to come. It&#8217;s going to be worthwhile following him on Twitter ([@fbta][2]) and keeping an eye on his [personal page][3] to see the exciting things he is working on. I like to image, rightly or wrongly, Silicon Valley is a bit like a Disneyland for developers so I really can&#8217;t wait to see and hear all the cool things Finbarr will be able to get involved in.

So big thank you to Finbarr for all his help, time and brilliant games of badminton over the past few months and best of luck to both you and B. in California.
