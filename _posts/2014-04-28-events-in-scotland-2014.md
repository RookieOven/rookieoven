I thought it would be useful to do a quick roundup of some of the interesting events taking place across the Scottish tech community in the coming months. These are just a few of the event in the community if you think there&#8217;s anything I&#8217;ve missed add it to the comments or drop me an email.

The long running talent showcase by Informatics Ventures is back for 2014.

## Edinburgh Publishing Conference &#8211; ‘Disruption in Publishing’

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13713" alt="Edinburgh-Publishing-Conference" src="http://rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Edinburgh-Publishing-Conference.png" width="550" height="130" />][3]

20th June 2014  
[http://edinpubconf.net][4]  
Tickets &#8211; £99/149 (early bird until end of April 2014)

Following the success of last year’s Edinburgh Publishing Conference it returns in 2014 with a brilliant line up of speakers. Pick of the bunch for me are:

  * Cory Doctorow: award-winning writer, journalist, activist. His talk at O’Reilly’s 2013 “Tools of Change” conference was one of the highlights, and we’re delighted to have him as our main speaker.
  * Ian Ritchie CBE: Ian is well known in the Scottish tech community with International Computers Limited and Office Workstations Limited. Ian will be telling a short story about information, connectivity and learning from mistakes.
  * <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Rachel Willmer: founder of the ebook search site, Luzme and is a well known attendee of TechMeetups (and the odd RookieOven Meetup). With a host of domain experience it will be interesting to hear what Rachel has to say about disruption in the publishing industry.</span>

The event in in June and if you&#8217;re quick you can get yourself an early bird ticket for £99.

Scotch on the Rocks is an annual gathering of web technologists organised by Glasgow based Fuzzy Orange. SOTR brings together some of the brightest minds from across the globe. Focusing on development, best practices and human experience, Scotch on the Rocks has built a reputation as a must attend event.

So that&#8217;s just a few of the events coming up in the short term. There&#8217;s also many great events for particular user groups in the community such as:

  * [ScotlandJS][10] &#8211; 9th/10th May 2014
  * [Scottish Ruby Conference][11] - 12th/13 May 2014
  * [Drupal Camp Scotland][12] &#8211; 9th/10th May 2014

Also worth once again highlighting [Open Tech Calendar][13] and the [StartupDigest Scotland][14] which will both keep you up-to-date with events taking place across the Scottish community.
