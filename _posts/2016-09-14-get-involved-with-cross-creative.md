Without doubt one of my highlights for 2016 (so far) has been the Cross Creative programme ran by TRC Media. It gave me more confidence. Gave me amazing new connections both locally and in San Francisco. But best of all it transformed by startup [Add Jam](https://addjam.com). We would not be where we are now if it wasn't for Cross Creative. So if I were you I would stop reading and [get an application in immediately](http://trcmedia.org/?page_id=32) (closing date is 16th September)

##Why Cross Creative
The obvious attraction to taking part in Cross Creative is the 5 day field trip to San Francisco. While there I met amazingly talented people at Dropbox, IDEO, Facebook, YCombinator, Twitter, Pixar, Medium, Unity, Xamarin and more. An impressive list of companies. They were all so open and willing to share insight into their culture, processes and kept us well fed and watered. I wrote up my experiences in San Francisco on the [Add Jam blog](https://blog.addjam.com/learnings-from-silicon-valley-part-one-dfe05e6bd03d) across three blog posts, please do check them out.

##Need convincing?
As if a funded field trip to San Francisco with access to some of the biggest tech companies in the world wasn't big enough motive to apply the amazing training and people you meet should.

Prior to Cross Creative I didn't know anyone from the other businesses on the programme - Axis Animation, Solius Group, Newspaper Club, MadeBrave and Screenmedia. But thanks to the programme I do now. The 6 months of training and the trip to America is amazing but TRC keep such a high calibre of participants it create's real value in getting to know the fellow participants. For me that alone was well worth taking part.

The training itself is world class. From negotiating skills to communication. The sessions will improve you as a person, your business and ultimately make you more successful.

##Apply damn it!

It was a once in a lifetime trip. Hugely inspirational. You would be insane not to even try getting involved with the programme. [Applications close on the 16th September](http://trcmedia.org/?page_id=32), its a simple form, no excuse not to get one submitted. Do it!
