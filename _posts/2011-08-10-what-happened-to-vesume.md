    What Could Have Been
  </p>
</div>

With Vesume we were planning to visualise CV&#8217;s, now if that sounds familiar that&#8217;s because [vizualize.me][1] beat us to the punch. We had been working on the project for 6 weeks or so when visualize.me was first announced. The guys and I were sure we could do a better job however things aren&#8217;t quite panning out that way and the short of it is the startup I&#8217;ve been working on with [Christopher][2] and [Finbarr][3] is now dead.

The reason Vesume is no more is our amazing team is disbanding. Finbarr has an amazing opportunity ahead of him and he is moving out to the Valley to work for one of the hottest startups of recent times. It&#8217;s an exciting time for him and I wish him and his lovely wife Barbara all the best over there.

Chris had what you would label a &#8216;calling&#8217; to become a Doctor and has decided to return to University to study medicine. Which was a bit out of the blue to say the least. I&#8217;d never imagined Chris, who started his first startup whilst in University, doing anything other than being an entrepreneur but it&#8217;s clear this is what he wants to do. Again I wish him the best of luck but at the same time fingers crossed he never treats me.

So that now leaves me. Well I&#8217;m determined to build a successful startup and will continue to develop further a few projects I&#8217;ve been working on. I also hope to round out my skill set by returning to University to gain a Masters. In the coming year I will be a busy boy with the Masters and my own projects but I am committed to this blog and to maintain it and continue the meetup on the first Monday of each month.

Exciting times ahead for all three of us but not as we would have thought 2 months ago.
