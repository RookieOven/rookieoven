Last week I attended the London Web Summit for RookieOven. IÂ curated the best tweets, quotes and pictures on my [Storify][1], which is embedded below.

The London Web Summit was a great chance to see the newest startups in the tech scene, and hear from some experienced industry leaders.

Over the next few weeks I will blog some more thoughts on what we can learn from the London startup scene here in Scotland.
