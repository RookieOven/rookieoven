For July the monthly RookieOven meetup will be using a new venue as the usual venue, the Bier Halle on Sauchiehall Street, has closed for refurbishment we will be moving the meetup to the Gordon Street branch of Bier Halle (which is just off Buchanan Street). As usual the meetup will be from half 6 onwards and the first Monday of the month (i.e. the 2nd of July/this Monday coming).

For this meetup how about we try something a little different? Up until now the meetups have had no agenda with founders and enthusiasts coming along to talk startups, development, design, marketing and whatever takes their fancy. However in the past 6 weeks I&#8217;ve been seeing a bit of a problem in the community and I really think we should be talking about. So for the meetup in July I propose we set a little topic of discussion; how we can foster more talent in the local startup community.

So many companies in Scotland are looking for talented developers, designers, marketers and bright talented people in many more disciplines that have the attitude and work ethic required to be part of tech startup team. This is a problem we need to address and the RookieOven meetup is a great opportunity for the local community to get together to discuss and share opinions. Do you agree this is a good idea?

Hopefully you do and we can have a productive meetup with some great outcomes we can use to improve the community. See you there on Monday?
