So what next for RookieOven? Well firstly there is the RookieOven meetup in Glasgow on the 6th February. This will be the first one of 2012 and I&#8217;m looking forward to catching up with familiar faces and hopefully seeing some new ones too. The meetup will take place in the usual place (Hippo Lounge Sauchiehall Street) from half 6 onwards tho get there sharpish if you fancy some free pizza.

Secondly, you may have noticed I&#8217;ve not been updating the site too regularly and it&#8217;s basically because I&#8217;m snowed under with work. Now I&#8217;m under no illusions, all the RookieOven stuff I&#8217;ve been doing is small fry but I do feel that through the blog and meetup I&#8217;ve had a positive impact on the local startup community. For me at least I&#8217;ve regularly met people who inspire that are successful and making money through the internet, then there&#8217;s the talented developers, the lawyers into their tech, excellent designers and I&#8217;ve met the people behind some awesome products and services.

I currently don&#8217;t have any ads or affiliate links or any funding for the site or meetup and I intend to keep it that way, nice and impartial, but what I would like to see change is the content on the site. Up til now it has mainly been my wrambling but I would like to see more content from around the community.

I&#8217;ve always been open to folk posting on the site and in fact Jamie McHale of seeu.at has written [excellent posts][1] on [several occasions][2]. If a local startup has something to share I&#8217;d love them to put it on RookieOven. So if anyone wants to post about their experience in anything startup related then get in touch. I&#8217;m really open to almost any type of content as long as it&#8217;s startup relevant &#8211; tips for development, clever ways to monitize, experience obtaining funding, experience hiring or being hired, marketing tips or maybe something you would like to callout. So if you have something to say that will help tech startups in Scotland [get in touch][3].

As I was saying RookieOven in the grand scheme of things is small fry and I don&#8217;t think the site is going to rival TechCrunch or The Next Web anytime soon (ever) but I feel there are enough eyes coming here for it to beneficial on many levels to have a mix of content from a range of people in the community.

Agree? Would love to hear your thoughts&#8230;
