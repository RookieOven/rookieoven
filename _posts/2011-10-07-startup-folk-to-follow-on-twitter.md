It&#8217;s no secret Twitter is a great place to discover new content and connect with new people but that&#8217;s only if you&#8217;re following the right people. It&#8217;s easy to follow the [@arrington&#8217;s][1] and the [@jason&#8217;s][2] on Twitter but what about people who aren&#8217;t on the suggested follow list? Here are a few startup folk to follow on Twitter due to their content, banter, advice and everything else you would expect to see from a good tweeter.

  * [@sohear][3] - Steve O&#8217;Hear was contributing editor at TechCrunch Europe and is now CEO and co-founder of &#8216;expertise platform&#8217; [Beepl][4]. Switching from being a writer commenting on tech startups to being a founder gives Steve a unique perspective and his caffeine fuelled tweets show the time, effort and dedication required to be a founder.
  * [@][5][joelgascoigne][6] &#8211; A Brit who has moved to San Francisco, Joel is founder of [BufferApp][7] for Twitter. Joel and his fellow co-founder [@LeoWid][8] share a lot of great content and are always happy to interact and share advice and pointers. The guys are, in my experience, happy to share their time and advice with fellow startups.
  * [@AndrewBrackin][9] - A British youngster, 17 years old, very much into his startups. Andrew is currently working on [GetDealy][10] which offers &#8220;Awesome deals on the hottest Mac titles&#8221;. Andrew often shares great tech startup content and has massively championed some brilliant startups such as [Turntable.fm][11] before the big boys.
  * [@weblivz][12] &#8211; Steven Livingstone is in my opinion the most prolific tweeter on startup matters from my neck of the woods. Steven is a tech advisor to Glasgow based startup Kiltr and often tweets about startup life, technology, developemnt and a Glasgow football team (all good in my book).
  * [@JessInBlue][13] &#8211; Not only is Jessica Williamson part of the excellent Startup Cafe team along but she is also Community Manager at Cambridge based startup accelerator Springboard. I don&#8217;t think there is anyone who knows the UK startup scene better than Jessica (and I think she really does only ever wear blue).
  *  <a href="http://twitter.com/evarley" target="twitter">@evarley</a> - Elizabeth Varley is CEO and co-founder of London tech workspace TechHub. It was through following Elizabeth I heard of a TechHub open day back in May of this year which I went to and met a bucket load of top startup talent, well worth the trip.

I know its hardly an exhaustive list, in fact its really little more like an extended Follow Friday but thats where you come in. It&#8217;s great fun to find new people to follow so who am I missing?
