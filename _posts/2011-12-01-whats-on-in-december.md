You would think with the end of the year quickly approaching and the weather getting even worse the number of quality events for startups to attend wold be drying up. Well that&#8217;s not the case and there are plenty of great events taking place in the month ahead. Obviously I&#8217;m going to be adding all the events to the Startup Digest which comes out each Monday but I thought it would be a good idea to highlight a couple of the stand out events.

Of course there is the last RookieOven meetup of 2011, although the [plans changed][1] I&#8217;m looking forward to having a few pints with familiar faces and hopefully some new ones on Monday. Starting from the usual time of half 6, all welcome and there are no tickets just turn up.

[Northern Lights][2] on the 2nd in Aberdeen. Short notice I know but it&#8217;s looking to be a cracking event with Joe O&#8217;Brien of Edge Case and CTO of GitHub Tom Preston-Werner speaking. The theme for the day is &#8216;taking you and your business to the next level&#8217; so should be ideal for startup types. Northern Lights also has tied to it a pre-conference dinner followed by a GitHub Drinkup in Musa and they are happening tonight.

The following day Joe Wright, who organises the Glasgow TechMeetup, Adrian Mowat and Rob Lally are bringing the  [Global Day of Code Retreat][3] to Glasgow. Worldwide there will be 600 developers taking part to practice the craft of software development. It&#8217;s free to attend although spaces are limited.

There is an excellent doubleheader in Edinburgh in the middle of the month with the regular TechMeetup on the 14th then on the 15th of December there is the [Edinburgh Startup Christmas Party][4]. The party sounds like the ideal way  to celebrate 2011. Food, drinks, a &#8216;magical&#8217; DJ and likeminded people, what else could you want? The party is in Cargo from half 6 onwards with tickets £15 (£10 early bird).

These are the events I&#8217;ve came across and think look brilliant but have I missed anything?
