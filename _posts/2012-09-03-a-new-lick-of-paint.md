Welcome to the new look RookieOven. The site has been given a fresh new look thanks to Greg Cooper (aka [@Awfy][1]), co-founder of [Interstate][2], and the timing couldn&#8217;t be better.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1221" title="rookieoven" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rookieoven1.png" alt="RookieOven Blog" width="500" height="169" />][3]

Today I finish studying my Masters Degree; up until now RookieOven has mainly been done whilst I was studying, fitting in blog posts between lectures, adding features between pieces of coursework etc. However now I&#8217;m finished I want to focus on RookieOven to ensure it really does add a substantial amount to the Scottish tech startup community. I plan to have more regular posts, more varied posts and most importantly more posts from across Scotland.

It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been saying since starting RookieOven; Scotland is a small country. As a community we can&#8217;t afford to be locked up in our own little clusters. A short train journey can take you the breadth of the country yet we seem to have an issue traversing this distance; hopefully this is where RookieOven comes in. I would love it if members of the Scottish startup community would contribute to the site with issue&#8217;s affecting them in their area or to share their experiences.

Over the coming months I&#8217;m eager to see it come to fruition that the community contribute to the site and for RookieOven to become a valuable asset to the Scottish community. For this to happen it&#8217;s going to need the community pulling together. You in?
