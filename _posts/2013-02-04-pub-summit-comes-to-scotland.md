Last year the guys behind the Web Summit confrences and F.ounders started a global networking event called [Pub Summit][1] and 2013 sees the return of these events but this time on a large scale.. Instead of connecting with 50 communities; in 2012 there will be 100 cities in every corner of the world to brought together over a pint. And Scotland will be providing not one but two of these cities.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10451" title="Pubsummit-logo" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Pubsummit-logo1.png" alt="Pub Summit" width="540" height="126" />][2]

The Glasgow Pub Summit, cohosted by **RookieOven,** will take place tonight (4th February) in **[Vespbar, Drury St, Glasgow][3]** from 6.30 onwards. To get your ticket apply [here][4]. Tickets are complimentary. Simply RSVP and invite 3 friends.

This will be followed by the Edinburgh Pub Summit on the 21st of February and it will be cohosted by the **Float **team, Colin Hewitt and Philip Roberts, and **TechCube**. Again; attendees will need to [register for a ticket][5].

Pub Summits are informal and give a chance for people to unwind with a pint and meet fellow foudners and enthusiasts. It&#8217;s very much in the spirit of the regular [RookieOven Meetup][6] which takes place each month in Glasgow.

The Pub Summit events are an excellent opportunity for the Scottish tech community to connect with other tech communities around the world. The likes of London, Berlin, Madrid, Paris and San Francisco will also be hosting Pub Summits in the coming weeks.

Will you be there to represent the Scottish tech community?
