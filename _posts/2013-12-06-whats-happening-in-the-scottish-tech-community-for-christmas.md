We&#8217;ve had the first snow fall of the winter and it&#8217;s just a little over two weeks until Christmas. Workplaces across the country will be heading out on Christmas nights outs but what about the startups of Scotland? Well Colin Hewitt of Float has put together an amazing line up for Scotland Startup Christmas Party which will take place in Edinburgh on Thursday the 12th December.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13681" alt="Startup Party" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/edinburgh-startup-party.png" width="550" height="198" />][1]

Tickets are Â£25 and for that you&#8217;l be treated to food, drinks and excellent entertainment. Plus you&#8217;ll of course be mingling with the best of the Scottish tech community. The likes of Kotikan, Float, Insight Arcade, Mallzee, FreeAgent and more will be there.

## Glasgow Tech Community Christmas Meetup

In Glasgow there will be gathering of the Scottish tech community at the Christmas market on Wednesday 18th. With there being no Refresh, RookieOven Meetup or TechMeetup in December this is a good opportunity to meet up with peers across the Glasgow tech community for a final banter of 2013.

From 6.30 at the Christmas Market let&#8217;s get together to celebrate successes in 2013 and look ahead to what we will be doing in 2014.
