[The ultimate collection game WallaBee][1] is one of 5 finalists in the Startup2.0 competition in Bilbao. Taking place 15-16th of June WallaBee CEO and founder Ben Dodson is heading off to the Nonick Conference to present WallaBee to the prestigious jury.

WallaBee is a social location based mobile application (or as the cool kids call it &#8216;SoLoMo&#8217;) where you forage at the over 2 million in game locations to collect items or the in game currency of Honeycombs. The game is an iOS app and is a free download from the [App Store][2] where it has been available since February this year. Despite its youth WallaBee has grown a solid user base and a great community and with a major update due for release in the coming weeks it&#8217;s set to only get better.

WallaBee is a part-Scottish startup with co-founder and Head of Creative Alan Shaw based in Glasgow. Alan won&#8217;t be going to Bilbao but will be cheering Ben on and is grateful for the chance to be a finalist, &#8220;Its just a great opportunity to go and showcase our hard work. We wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get this far without our users.&#8221;.

It&#8217;s fantastic to see a British startup do well (and as a Scot its even better when its a part-Scottish one). Will have my fingers crossed for the guys this weekend.
