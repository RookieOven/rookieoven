Being a startup founder isn&#8217;t easy and you need all the help you can get thankfully for Scottish tech startups there are lots of excellent resources. As with anything there are a lot of dubs out there but some of these resources every founder in Scotland should be aware of. Here are, in my opinion, 10 essential tech startup resources:

  1. **[StartupDigest Scotland][1]** - this weekly email is something I curate. Comes out every Monday morning and highlights the best events in the week ahead and provides a recap on the weekly happenings in the Scottish startup scene. Free to sign up to and unobtrusive.
  2. **[TechMeetup Mailing List][2]** &#8211; Jobs, discussions, announcements and a bit of banter all happen on this great mailing list. Currently sitting at 656 members the list is a great place to find out what is going on in Scotland.
  3. **[Edinburgh Lean Circle Mailing List][3]** &#8211; another brilliant Google Group. These guys arrange some fantastic events so well worth signing up for these alone.
  4. **[StartupCafe RSS][4]** - Although a bit quiet of late Startup Cafe still produces great content for startups and has a great archive of posts.
  5. **[Start It Lean Mailing List][5]** &#8211; Blog by non-technical founder Scott Torrance. Focusing on his journey developing his idea using lean methodologies and lean thinking.
  6. **[Informatics Ventures Mailing List][6]** &#8211; Keep up to date with the work of Informatics Ventures. Some awesome events take place in Scotland thanks to these guys, the likes of the [Bill Joos pitching workshop][7] and [Engage Invest Exploit][8] [each year][9].
  7. **[Entrepreneurial Spark LinkedIn Group][10]** - One of the most active LinkedIn groups I&#8217;m a member of. Lots of great content and discussion going on.
  8. **[Edinburgh2][11]** &#8211; simple yet effective site. You can quickly see what regular meetups and user group meetings are meeting each month in Edinburgh.
  9. **[Glasgow2][12]** - There is now also Glasgow2 which serves the same purpose as Edinburgh2 but for, you guessed it, Glasgow.
 10. **[Dundee Web Standards][13]** - a monthly social gathering of like-minded individuals in the creative industries based in and around Dundee. Be sure to keep an eye on the [blog][14] and the [twitter account][15].

Here are some other important resource you can sign up to, although I&#8217;m maybe a bit biased:

  * **[RookieOven RSS][16]**
  * **[RookieOven on Facebook][17]**
  * **[RookieOven on Twitter][18]**
  * **[RookieOven on Google+][19]**

These are the resources I think Scottish tech startup founders can&#8217;t afford to not to be aware of. Can you suggest some more?
