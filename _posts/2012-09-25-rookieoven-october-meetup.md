September draws to a close this week and that means the next RookieOven meetup is on the horizon. Taking place on Monday 1st of October in the city centre of Glasgow. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to meet like minded folk and discuss startups with your peers.

The venue for the RookieOven meetup is Vespbar which is a short walk from either Glasgow Central or Queen Street Station. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre. We will be in the downstairs section but any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_1][2]) or the [RookieOven twitter][3] account. If you sign up to the Vespbar mailing list you can also get yourself a free pizza.

September has been an eventful month in the Scottish tech scene. Tickets for Startup Weekend Edinburgh went on sale, several Scottish startups recieved major [coverage in the likes of TechCrunch][4] and RookieOven itself was on the front page of [Hacker News][5]. The meetup in October also marks the one month anniversary of the excellent new RookieOven design by [@awfy][6], cofounder of [Interstate][7].

October is bound to be an eventful month for Scottish startups with [CEO Masterclasses][8], [workshops][9] and I expect a few product launches so lets kick it off together.

See you there?
