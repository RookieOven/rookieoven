Cally Russell, founder of RecommendedBy, recently won the Entrepreneurial Spark #startuptweetday with his campaign of 10 tips for start-ups.

Here are his ten tips in full for young entrepreneurs,

  1. Know your market inside out.
  2. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, actually actively look for it.
  3. Learn from mistakes and move on. They will make you stronger in time.
  4. Play to your strengths, whatever they might be
  5. Embrace the pivot, customers and ideas change. Adapt before you have to!
  6. Keep it lean. Don’t spend money if you can avoid it until you’ve proven the concept.
  7. Follow your gut. If it doesn’t feel right – it isn’t!
  8. Cash is king but not in the early days. Don’t spend all your time chasing grants. Grow a business!
  9. Age is but a number. If you’re good enough you’re old enough.
 10. 10. Try, try and try again. Dust yourself off and try again. You will crack it – one day!

What do you think? Agree with Cally? Love to hear what tips you would share with a young entrepreneur.
