Last week the BBC aired a documentary called &#8220;Mark Zuckerberg: Inside Facebook&#8221; that strangely had very little Mark Zuckerberg in it.Â I&#8217;m the first to admit Facebook is far from my cup of tea and the Facebook stance on privacy grinds my gears but love him or hate him you have to admire Mark Zuckerberg for growing Facebook into the company it is today. So I think it&#8217;s worthwhile listening to what he has to say, in the video below from the 2011 YCombinator Startup School Jessica Livingston interviews Zuckerberg. He talks openly about the early days of Facebook, his opinion on investment and his approach to management.



Much better than the BBC program, don&#8217;t you agree?
