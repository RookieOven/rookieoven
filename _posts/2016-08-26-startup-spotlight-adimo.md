Each Friday the RookieOven Startup Spotlight highlights a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on Scotland’s best startups from across the country. It’s an opportunity to share information about an exciting tech startup from Scotland you may not have heard of. Giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. This week the spotlight falls on Adimo.

##Favorite thing about Startup Spotlights:

After writing numerous Startup Spotlights, I have noticed one of my favorite things is when a company writes back with such comedic and perfect explanations for their business it becomes hard to top what they have written. This is the exact case with [Adimo](https://adimo.co/).

I had the wonderful opportunity to talk with the Adimo team to better understand their company. So please join me as we learn more from Adimo.

##How it all started:
"The idea for the business came about as the result of problems that Richie (our CEO) experienced working on digital marketing projects for high profile FMCG clients whilst working agency side. Without the ability to create sales online, some of the biggest brands in the world were spending vast quantities of budget driving shoppers to websites that didn’t let them actually buy. The result? Lost revenue, missed opportunities and an inability to track the performance of their investment.""

"Adimo’s technology was developed to solve this. It allows consumers to add products to their online shopping baskets directly from digital marketing. Since then, Adimo has developed a suite of technology that can be integrated into any digital marketing activity from display advertising to social media, website integrations, video, apps and more."

##How how would you describe Adimo now?:

"Adimo is a forward-thinking business with an ability to solve problems big and small. The team has a diverse range of skills and experience and there is an overarching hunger to see the business flourish.

We are always looking for the next way to make the business better and we try to have a good time while we’re doing it! "

##Cheesy but true - Every team member counts:
"As cheesy as it sounds, every member of the team is key. As a lean business everyone’s contribution makes a big difference to our ultimate success, whether it’s skillfully handling a client query, developing a tricky new touchpoint (like our awesome new [Native Video integration](https://campaigns.adimo.co/campaigns/sales/touchpoints/vod.html?minimalMode=false)) or simply articulating what we do to a potential customer."

Can we just appreciate how much fun this team has together:

##So how do you fund Adimo?
The Adimo team describes their funding process in a way we can all relate:

* Phase 1 – Blood, sweat and tears.
* Phase 2 – Bootstrapped from revenue
* Phase 3 – Investment

They do this all using the Software as a Service (SAAS) business model. Check out their campaign [here](https://campaigns.adimo.co/campaigns/sales/touchpoints/vod.html?minimalMode=false).
