Each week the RookieOven Startup Spotlight ordinarily aims to highlight a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on the best startups from across the country however this week I&#8217;m throwing the net a bit wider to highlight something that I feel the Scottish community should be embracing &#8211; [Tech Britain][1].

Founded earlier this year by [Shaun Gibson][2] and [Doug Ward][3], Tech Britain is an ambitious attempt to map out, not just an area or community but the entire UK tech scene. The guys have spend most of the year travelling the country by any means possible to connect hubs such as Glasgow, Dundee and Edinburgh with others in England Wales and Northern Ireland.

I can highly relate to their reasons for founding Tech Britain. A failed startup behind them and a frustration at a lack of cohesion amongst our geographically small nation, a dissatisfaction with the focus on a single &#8216;hub&#8217; for the UK startup scene (London) and deep passion to see the country be able to produce world class startups on a regularly basis.

The guys started out by touring the UK and conducting interviews with members of communities and then sharing these videos on their [YouTube channel][4]. Since then they have developed the Tech Britain map:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9821" title="tech-britain-map" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tech-britain-map.png" alt="Tech Britain Map" width="540" height="255" />][5]

The map clearly lists the startups, incubators, accelerators and investors that make up the various tech communities of the UK. The map has the potential to become a powerful tool for startups in the UK and a &#8216;go to&#8217; place for those wishing to discover the UK tech scene. If you feel you belong on the map you can [add yourself or suggest an addition][6] on the Tech Britain site.

Entirely self funded, Shaun and Doug couch surfed the UK to foster the links amongst the communities that have made Tech Britain possible. The guys have invested a lot of their time, effort and money into the Tech Britain initiative. It&#8217;s a massive undertaking for two young guys and I personally think they&#8217;ve achieved something remarkable.

I think the least we can do, as a community in Scotland, is to get behind Tech Britain.
