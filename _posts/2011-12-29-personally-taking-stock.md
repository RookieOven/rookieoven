It&#8217;s been a busy year for me, as clichéd as it is, there have been plenty of up and downs and as the year is finishing thought it would be a good idea to stick some of my experiences on RookieOven.

### Uncertainty

At the start of 2011 there was a lot of uncertainty, [dizeo][1] had little to no traction but at the same time the team had made Parental Circle a niche Q&A that we would use to roll out a simple clean Q&A across other niches. The team had learned a bucket load from the failed launch of dizeo and we did a much better job of it with Parental Circle; unfortunately time/money ran out. Parental Circle may not have saved the operation but as with dizeo I did learn a lot, this time through what I was doing right &#8211; meeting people. Through Parental Circle I met some really great people who were more than happy to help, it was a community thing. There are some really strong online communities in Glasgow and it was through being part of the parent one (without actually being a parent) I realised there was something missing for startups which ultimately led to RookieOven.

### Moving On

So at the end of April I was out of a job and quickly moved to working again with Chris and also with Finbarr on what would become (or not) Vesume. That didn&#8217;t work out, [as I explained][2], but yet again it really wasn&#8217;t time wasted. Working with they guys was a treat, you always want to work with the best and for that wee while I was working with two hugely talented guys.

### Improve

It&#8217;s hard to believe that a year ago I had practically no online presence, a hastily made LinkedIn profile, a barely used Twitter account, and offline my &#8216;professional network&#8217; was limited to say the least. The reason for this is I&#8217;m far from the most confident person in the world but when I look back I think this is one respect where I&#8217;ve improved a monumental amount. 12 months ago I would never attend a meetup or conference by myself never mind organise one. I&#8217;m still horrifically shy and severely lacking in confidence but it&#8217;s definitely something I can (and will) work on further in 2012.

### Where I am

When talking to people in 2011 I found the converstation would usuall go something like this:

> Person: &#8220;So what do you do?&#8221;
> 
> Me: &#8220;I&#8217;m worked as a Software Engineer at at a startup now founding my own&#8230;&#8221;
> 
> Person: &#8220;So you&#8217;re a coder? Can you do apps?&#8221;

That&#8217;s not really a new conversation, a few years ago you would take away &#8220;apps&#8221; and add in &#8220;websites&#8221; or if you were talking to someone under 12 you would substitute &#8220;apps&#8221; for &#8221;games&#8221;. I felt I was being put in a bucket when I really feel my talents are multifaceted and I could easily put myself into other buckets so rightly or wrongly I decided to return to University to study a Masters in Product Development. Of late the ups and downs are coming from University, there is a lot to like and quite often even more to dislike but at the moment I feel in the long run this is going to be something beneficial to me.

### Looking Back

When I look back the first 3 years of my undergraduate at University it really was Mickey Mouse stuff, I was a typical drunk student for most of that time, but in the 4th Year (2010) I knuckled down and developed my skill set massively but even then I feel this year has been one where I&#8217;ve easily learned twice as much.

### Looking Forward

Going forward in 2012 I clearly have a lot to look forward to but I also have a few fears, I&#8217;m going to be 25 this year (geez!!) and currently I&#8217;ve got no stable source of income and I&#8217;m mainly living on savings. With University and other interests such as RookieOven and hopefully organising Startup Weekend in Glasgow that leaves me with little time to work on anything I can make money on. It&#8217;s a tough one for me to balance but I&#8217;m determined to get my Masters and I&#8217;m certain I will get a few products launched before too long that I will monetize.

What will you be doing in 2012 and how was 2011 for you?
