So far this year Scotland has been home to many brilliant tech events and that trend looks to continue as we close out 2013. Here are a selection of top tech events this small country of ours is hosting up until the end of 2013. Any events I&#8217;ve missed? Add them in the comments or tweet them to [@RookieOven][1].

  * **Date: 23rd -24th August**
  * **Tickets: [£249 + £15.22 booking fee][3]**

Turing is a festival that brings together digital technology and the web within the world&#8217;s largest arts and creative gathering in a celebration of digital culture and creativity. Named in honour of Alan Turing, father of modern computing, the festival moves beyond traditional tech conferences to explore the ways in which technology is affecting all aspects of culture and society.

Speakers include D.J. Powers from Valve, Neal Stephenson and Jim McKelvey co-founder of Square. Now in its third year Turing is continually growing and I highly recommend attending.

Also worth checking out the various Fringe events such as [Tech Jobs Scotland][5] and [Mostly Functional Conf][6].
