[ProductTank][1] is a series of local events by product managers, for product managers. They started in London in March 2010 and have since spread to Tel Aviv, New York, Amsterdam and now Edinburgh. The inaugural ProductTank Edinburgh event will be taking place on Tuesday 23rd of October.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4091" title="producttank-logo-crop" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/producttank-logo-crop.png" alt="Product Tank Edinburgh" width="540" height="141" />][2]

As I said ProductTank is organised by product managers for their peers and ProductTank Edinburgh is being organised by one of the leading product managers in the country; Rachel Evatt, Product Director of Skyscanner. The inaugural ProductTank Edinburgh will be taking place in the brand new Skyscanner offices.

ProductTank takes the form of a presentation but also provides plenty opportunity to mingle and chat matters product management with peers. For the first Edinburgh event Martin Ericksson**,** Chief Product Officer at Covestor, the founder of ProductTank will be presenting on what exactly is product management, what ProductTank is and a will share a bit about the recent conference MindTheProduct 2012 which was held in London.

Product management has been a hot topic of late in the Scottish startup community, fuelled no doubt by the recent [ScotlandIS event with Chris Dolezalek][3] of IMVU. In Scotland there are now Tech Meetups across the country and developer events such as user groups and conferences are a regular occurrence. However there are very few events focusing on product, this is despite product management being integral to many startups.

ProductTank Edinburgh is a valuable addition to the community and it would be great to see a large turnout at the inaugural event on 23rd of October.  Rachel is making use of  a [Meetup group][4] to organise the group and those interested in attending should join and RSVP.

Great to see ProductTank come to Scotland and hopefully it will spread to other cities in the country.
