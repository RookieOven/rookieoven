2015 has been a mega year for the Scottish tech community. WE've had Fanduel crowned a Unicorn, CodeBase has continued to grow, Code Clan has started to educate the next generation of developers, 4J and Outplay are producing great things in Dundee and in Glasgow we opened the [RookieOven Coworking](/coworking) Space and have grown even stronger as a community. Therefore it makes sense that as we approach Christmas and wind down 2015 we should get together an celebrate our hard work for the year. Thankfully across the country there's plenty of parties

##Glasgow Tech Christmas Party

In 2014 the community had a great party with over 80 devs and entrepreneurs coming together and 2015 is going to be bigger. Unleash your best (ugliest) Christmas jumpers, Santa Hats and inner festive beast, and cheer to an awesome year in the Glasgow Tech world with likeminded people.
