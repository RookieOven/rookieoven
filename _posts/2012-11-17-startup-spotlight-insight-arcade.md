Each week the [RookieOven Startup Spotlight][1] highlights a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on the best startups from across the country. In creating a more cohesive startup community in Scotland I feel it’s important to share information about exciting Scottish startups you may not have heard of. With the Startup Spotlight I give a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. This week the spotlight falls on a startup with it&#8217;s origin in the small town of Tullibody; [Insight Arcade][2].

Insight Arcade, founded by Allan Lloyds, has thus far been self funded. The mission is to match skills gaps with learning opportunities through an online marketplace. To achieve this they’re aggregating course information from training providers worldwide and will provide learners with personalised curriculums backed with the group purchasing power of an entire marketplace.

Allan started work on the concept in Tullibody in 2011 to assist independent teachers who were leaving community education. Subsequently however he realised there was no fully comprehensive marketplace of training opportunities and pivoted towards aggregation. Work began in earnest on the new model in May 2012.

Insight Arcade recently joined the ranks of “TempCube”, the temporary working space in Edinburgh being used by several companies in anticipation of the full Edinburgh TechCube opening. Being based in TechCube/TempCube is advantageous to Insight Arcade as the team are constantly put in contact with talented founders and mentors. Allan says “what TechCube offers Scottish tech startups is unparalleled across the country and will surely drive the growth and development of the Scottish tech scene”.

Insight Arcade are currently running a closed alpha and will be opening a beta program in the coming weeks.
