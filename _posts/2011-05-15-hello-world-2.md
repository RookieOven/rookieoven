So I figure if I&#8217;m going to co-found a startup I may as well share my experiences. Its going to be an interesting journey, regardless of whether things pan out as planned.

I may as well at this stage introduce my fellow co-founders because I will likely mention them quite a bit in this blog. [Finbarr][1] and [Chris][2] are two fellow graduates from Strathclyde (although they will be quick to point out they have Masters degree&#8217;s and I only have an Honors). This venture is actually my second bite at the startup cherry with Chris as I had previously joined him at Arkly where we built two fantastic products, dizeo.com and Parental Circle.

I would also like to use this blog to review and promote UK based tech startups. I found in my time at Arkly getting the word out about your startup is the most important thing but also one of the most difficult. If you have a startup and want me to have a shot send me an email or tweet me.

So with all these hopes and ambitions for this blog I feel the name Rookie Oven is ideal. Agree?
