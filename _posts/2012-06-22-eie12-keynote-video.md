There were a few posts on RookieOven about EIE after the event, one highlighting [some of the startups exhibiting and presenting][1] and another with an [overview of the talk by Sir Jackie Stewart][2]. I&#8217;ve just came across the video of the keynote by Sir Jackie and I encourage everyone to watch it. The keynote was recorded by Informatics Ventures, the organisers of EIE12, on the day and they have uploaded the video to Vimeo (embedded below).

I hope you agree that he was a fantastic speaker; I feel I gained a lot from listening to him and the experiences he shared. Next year at EIE13 Informatics Ventures have Sir Tom Hunter presenting the Keynote which I&#8217;m sure will be just as awesome.
