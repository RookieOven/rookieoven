Each Friday the RookieOven [Startup Spotlight][1] highlights a member of the Scottish tech startup community. The aim is to, as the name suggests, put the spotlight on Scotland’s best startups. It’a an opportunity to share information about an exciting tech startup from Scotland you may not have heard of. Giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. I think it&#8217;s important that RookieOven not only highlights Scottish success and talent within the country but also the talent we export, a perfect example of this is [Greg Cooper][2], cofounder of [Interstate][3].

Interstate is a project management tool, providing users with a way to manage their projects using easy and powerful roadmaps. Based in San Francisco, Greg and his cofounder [Simon][5] were part of the YCombinator summer intake of 2011. This provided the guys money, mentoring, advice and access to an unparalleled alumni network.

Interstate is a SAAS product using a subscription model of $9 per user per month and is aimed at web developers but the guys have customers using it in a range of industries. A powerful aspect of Interstate is the REST API, this customers to display their development roadmap publicly or internally without the need for people to ever visit Interstate.

The public Roadmap allows companies to engage with their own customers and engage with them in the product development process. For example Media Temple are using the roadmap (pictured below) to inform their customers of upcoming features and developments.

Although not a Scottish based company I think it’s important that Scottish startup community gets behind ambitious young founders such as Greg and that we offer our support and encouragement. To that end; [Interstate has a 30 day free trial][7], give it a go and provide Greg with your feedback and help spread the word and share your product roadmap in the comments.
