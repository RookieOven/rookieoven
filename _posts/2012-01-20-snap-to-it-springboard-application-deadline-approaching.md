If you&#8217;re thinking about applying to UK accelerator Springboard London as the title suggests you better snap to it. The application deadline is on the 29th January for the 13 week programme beginning in April this year.

So why go to Springboard? Well to start there&#8217;s the awesome list of mentors, with the likes of Immad Akhund of HeyZap, Danielle Morrill of Twilio and Alex Barrera of Inkzee. There is also the funding and support, with £5000 per founder (up to three founders) in funding for 6% of founders shares per startup and office space, legal services and a range of other important services for startups. If all that wasn&#8217;t incentive enough the Springboard 13 week programme ends with an investor day where the teams pitch to angel investors and venture capitalists.

This short video was made at the end of the last programme and gives a taste of what is on offer:

Springboard has a host of partners from the tech industry who are providing a load of swag for a startup goodie bag for applicants to the London programme with a value of over $500. Providing contents for the goodie bag are Microsoft, Rackspace, SendGrid, Twilio, Google, 99 designs, Pivotal Tracker and Edinburgh based FreeAgent.

Closing date for applications is the 29th so if you&#8217;re going for it get your [application in][1] now.
