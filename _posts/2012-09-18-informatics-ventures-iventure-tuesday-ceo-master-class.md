I cannot praise highly enough the work Informatics Ventures do for Scottish tech startups. The likes of [EIE each year][1] and the [Bill Joos workshop][2] are events of the highest quality and I know I personally have benefitted greatly from them.

First date for your diary is the return of iVenture Tuesday on the 25th September in Assembly Rooms Edinburgh. This series of events started last year and involves talks given by prominent members of the Scottish business community. The programme seeks to inspire and motivate those who wish to develop their careers in different directions or have entrepreneurial ambitions. Speakers at previous iVenture Tuesday talks include Jim McColl and Sir Tom Farmer.

At [iVenture Tuesday][3] in the evening of the 25th of September Alistair Brown, Chief Technology & Platforms Officer of STV Group, will talk Digital Media & Beyond. Subsequent iVenture Tuesdays include Bill Joos and Calum Paterson talking Venture Capital in October and Gareth Williams of SkyScanner talking about his experiences in November.

Another event from Informatics Ventures to check out is the [CEO Master Class in Glasgow][4] on the 10th of October. Taking place in Glasgow University, David Farquhar will be helping you answer &#8220;why is nobody buying my stuff?&#8221; drawing on aspects of Lean Startup methodology. The master class will deal with the key aspects of how to get the right products into customers&#8217; hands quicker.

David Farquhar has a wealth of experience so this is an excellent opportunity to learn from a seasoned entrepreneur and engage with fellow founders. The CEO Master Class, like iVenture Tuesday, is free to attend.

Can highly recommend iVenture Tuesdays and I&#8217;ve already booked into the CEO Master Class as I&#8217;m sure it will be beneficial to [CodeCreatedMe][5]. Will I be seeing you at any of these events?
