<img class="alignright" title="SICamp" src="http://launchpad.youngfoundation.org/files/images/SI_Camp.jpg" alt="Social Innovation Camp Logo" width="162" height="162" />This weekend is Social Innovation Camp from 7pm Friday to 4pm Sunday at the Informatics Forum in Edinburgh. The event is bringing together developers and designers to create innovate solutions to social problems.

Over the weekend everyone breaks out into six teams that will each develop one of the [six ideas][1] into a full web based solution to solve a particular social issue. Myself, Chris and Finbarr are all heading over and are really looking forward to it. If you fancy coming along as well there are spots available for developers, particularly:

  * Data visualisation experts
  * Database
  * Web (PHP/MYSQL, Ruby/Rails, etc)
  * Mobile
  * Interaction & product designers

The weekend is going to be a great fun and a brilliant opportunity to meet some talented individuals from a range of disciplines from across Scotland. Interested? Sign up [here][2] or give organiser Glen Mehn a tweet [@gmehn][3].

Let me know if I can expect to see you there.

UPDATE:

Me and the guys won&#8217;t be able to make it to Social Innovation Camp. Some exciting developments with our startup mean we can&#8217;t make it along. Will be keeping an eye on the hashtag for the day and look forward to seeing the ideas develop.
