This week we made great strides forward on Vesume (slight name change there). Unfortunately this meant we couldn&#8217;t make it along to Social Innovation Camp but a big well done to [FoodRadar][2] on winning.

During the week we met with [Scott Allison][3], Founder and CEO at [Teamly][4]. Scott has been unbelievably helpful to us and has given some exceptional advice. We are very grateful for all of Scotts help so much so we asked him to join us as an advisor. We also have another excellent advisor on board in [Jonathan May][5], Jonathan has a wealth of experience and has been very generous in sharing it with us.

So another week down and we have made big strides forward in building the product. Will be looking for beta testers in no time&#8230;
