The Poker Hands feature set is always increasing and Michael is always building from user feedback. If you&#8217;re a poker player and in need of some help you should definitely give the app a go. It&#8217;s available for free from the [Google Play Store][1].

Michael is also behind TwitAyr, a gathering of local developers, designers and tech enthusiasts. If you&#8217;re in the area and fit the bill keep an eye on the [TwitAyr][2] website for the date of the next meet.
