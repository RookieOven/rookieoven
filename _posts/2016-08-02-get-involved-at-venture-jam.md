VentureJam is a unique opportunity for 40-50 young people in Scotland. Young Scot and Glasgow City of Science are running a weekend ‘Jam’ that will see teams of young people developing fresh ideas that embrace the digital world to solve real world challenges. Throughout the Jam the young people will have access to a team of inspirational mentors from the world of television, gaming, product design and 3D animation as well as legal experts and environmental gurus. Young Scot will be there to guide the participants through the co-design process.
