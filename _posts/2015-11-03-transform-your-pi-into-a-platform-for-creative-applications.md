[Tingbot](http://tingbot.com) is designed to get your Raspberry Pi out of the drawer and back into your life. It lives in your home or on your desk; an internet-connected product. Our custom hardware and software transforms your Raspberry Pi into a platform for creative applications. Whether you’re new to code or an experienced developer, Tingbot has something to offer everyone.

The team behind Tingbot, NORD collective, is a team of designers and developers with a passion for making things together. The team is made up of Glasgow School of Art graduates and one of my former lecturers from the University of Strathclyde, Duncan Smeed. NORD collective have designed Tingbot for anyone who wants to experience the fun and joy of being creative with technology. You can design graphics, draw, connect to simple data feeds and make fun interactive apps. Use the touchscreen to make a doodle pad or make the programmable buttons control a robot. With Tingbot you’re free to make anything.

The desire to make Tingbot came from frustration at the under utalisation of Raspberry Pi's. So the team wanted to make something that made Pi’s easy to use and fun to tinker with, whilst looking cool enough to sit pride and place on desks or in homes. Tide (the Tingbot development environment) is the gateway to making apps for Tingbot. Download or create apps and run them on your Tingbot in seconds. Tide’s clever libraries make writing apps for Tingbot really simple.

Tingbot has been extremely well received at the UK Maker Faires through the intial development process. Now the team have taken to Kickstarter to raise capital to manufacture Tingbot at scale. The Kickstarter is live and as of writing is a quarter of the way to being funded already.
