This October 3000 attendees make their way to Dublin to participate in Europe’s Startup Festival - UPRISE. The RDS Arena hosts 150 exhibiting Startups coming from all over Europe and the U.S. This unique festival creates a single entry point for talent and the public into our fast growing tech community. Gone are the old conference mentalities but the approachable and inclusive ideals of bringing product back into the hands of those that use them.

So what can we expect at UPRISE?

* The Shelbourne Hall hosts the UPRISE Startup Marketplace where 150 Exhibiting Startups buy, sell and get feedback on their products and interact with the public.
* The Casino Stage has demonstrations, launches and mini-workshops by startups. Bank Of Ireland hosts their Startup Space and Google, Microsoft and Sendgrid offer mentoring sessions for participating companies.
* There's a Pitch Battle that will pit 6 Startups based in Ireland against 6 International Startups in 3 knockout rounds. Find the press release here.
* Throughout the day workshops run covering topics such as Artificial Intelligence to Investor Risk Assessment.
* Interactive Panels will be held to get the audience involved in topic debates with Cathy White (Tech City UK), Anna Boffetta (Balderton VC), Joe Griston (Freelancer.com).
