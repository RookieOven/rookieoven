<img class="alignright" title="TechMeetup Logo" src="http://techmeetup.co.uk/static/img/techmeetup_logo.png" alt="" width="190" height="43" />I&#8217;m sure you already know (because it was in the Scottish Startup Digest) that this Wednesday TechMeetup returns to Glasgow. The venue for Wednesday evening is the 5th floor of the Glasgow University School of Computing and it kicks off at 6.30 with some free beer and pizza. To find out some more information about the evening best have a look at the TechMeetup website &#8211; [http://www.techmeetup.co.uk][1]

Events such as TechMeetup are invaluable in Scotland. Scott Allison, CEO of Teamly, recently blogged on why &#8220;[Location Matters for Your Startup][2]&#8220;, in the post Scott shows how the right location will provided a higher density of the people you need to make your startup successful. In Scotland we don&#8217;t have anywhere near the entrepreneurial density of London never mind Boulder or San Francisco. Regular events like TechMeetup or the RookieOven meetups (next one November 7th) allow us Scots who are not currently in a position to move to an entrepreneurial dense area the opportunity to perhaps bump into the person (designer, developer, investor &#8211; really could be anyone) who will transform your business.

TechMeetup has been running for over 3 years now in Edinburgh but the Glasgow one stalled, as I understand it, due to difficulties with the venue and securing funding. With a good group getting involved and supporting TechMeetup Glasgow I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t stall again. It&#8217;s going to be good fun with beer, pizza and some exciting tech talks. So see you there on Wednesday?

*Big thanks to [Ijonas Kisselbach][3] and [Joe Wright][4] for organising TechMeetup Glasgow.*
