RookieOven website was one year old a few weeks back, for the past year I&#8217;ve been trying my best to promote Scottish tech startups, give advice and share relevant information. As well as the site I&#8217;ve been doing the RookieOven metup which is coming up for being one year old too so for the first birthday lets do something a little different.

The guys at [29 Studios][1] have been kind enough to open up their city centre studio to RookieOven and allow us to host a little get together on Friday 1st of June (bit short notice I know but was a bit busy with a [few other things of late][2]).

It&#8217;s going to be BYOB in the 29 Studios office, 84 Miller Street, Glasgow, G1 1DT from 7 o&#8217;clock onwards. As always free to come along just get a ticket from the Eventbrite page &#8211; [http://rookieoven.eventbrite.com/][3].

Spaces are limited so get your tickets quickly and I look forward to seeing you there Friday.
