Dare ProtoPlay is Scotland&#8217;s biggest video games festival and which this year has an Indie Fest aimed at supporting games startups. Running from the 10th to the 12th of August Dare Indie Fest is designed to help indies become more successful in their pursuit of a career in making games. There are two elements in the Dare Indie Fest: a showcase of your game and a conference with an amazing line-up of speakers.

The Dare Indie Fest is bringing practical advice from internationally successful companies to indie games developers as as well as an opportunity to make contacts and do business, as major publishers and funders like Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide will be there to meet indies and hear about their new games. Other top names in attendance include Andrew Smith of Spilt Milk Studios, Martin Beeby of Microsoft and Agostino Simonetta of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.

Over on the [Dare Indie Fest website][1] you can get your tickets for the event and find out some further information. It&#8217;s sure to be a busy three days with attendance last year over 9,000 and the venue this year having twice the capacity.
