Mental health is incredibly important yet something many founders neglect. We often pour ourselves into work and face the ups and downs of starting your own business. I think in general Scottish startups are good at being open about the challenges they're facing but rarely do we speak openly about our mental health. I'm excited to see Keep Calm and Start Talking taking place in RookieOven on the 21st of May. It's a free, one day, mental health awareness event being organised by Heather Evans.

##What to expect

So what does a free mental health awareness event entail? On the day there's going to be crafts, tai chi demos, info for sufferers/carers and lots of cupcakes.

Several local charities and services such as Breathing Space, CarrGomm, Bipolar Scotland, SeeMe, Scottish Recovery Network, Womenâ€™s Library, Sleep Scotland, Carers Trust, Mental Health Network Glasgow, VOX and the NHS Education Services are all offering support to the event and will be there on the day.
