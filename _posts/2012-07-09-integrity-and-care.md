At EIE12 Sir Jackie Stewart spoke of his motto, [integrity and care][1], and how these two traits are the cornerstone of his success. It&#8217;s something that resonated with me as integrity and care are two traits I personally strive to follow at all times. I&#8217;ve worked hard over the past year through RookieOven, the Scottish StartupDigest and by organsing Startup Weekend Glasgow to improve the state of affairs in Scotland for tech startups with no remuneration. Why? Because I care.

I care about the Scottish startup community and the individuals in it. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of effort trying to do my own little bit to help. I&#8217;m under no illusions that my contributions are only a tiny fraction of the puzzle but I do it to improve the community. In all these actions I strive to do so with integrity. In return I would only expect to be treated with the same integrity and care by others however recently it has become apparent some startups are severely lacking it, forcing me to reflect on why I bother. I won&#8217;t go into details but it was a crushing blow to say the least.

As I wrote about earlier this week [startup life is full of peaks and troughs][2], one minute you&#8217;re up and the next you&#8217;re knocked back down. The troughs really strip your confidence and are also compounded by past failures and set backs. The troughs make you wonder why you bother, is it all worth it and even make you questions if you should continue. With the recent happenings I was deeply in a trough. It&#8217;s a tough place to be and although my advice was to talk about it I&#8217;m not the sort of person to laden people with my troubles.

It was a less than perfect start to [CodeCreatedMe][3], my latest venture, however as is the case the trough was followed by a peak. How did I get to the peak? Well firstly I&#8217;m fortunate that with CodeCreatedMe I have fantastic co-founders in Chris and Kev, the support your co-founders can give is another key reason for creating a brilliant startup team.

The second reason for climbing out the trough is the &#8216;bad apples&#8217; in the Scottish community are thankfully the minority. The likes of the RookieOven meetup and the Edinburgh Pub Summit hosted by Skyscanner, both at the start of July, put me in physical contact with fellow founders in the community who do have integrity and care. The peers I was talking to likely didn&#8217;t know I was downhearted but simply sharing a pint with someone and talking shop does a lot for your confidence and state of mind. For me anyway it certainly ripped me out the trough and onto a peak.

These two simple networking events (which are relatively inexpensive, take note Scottish Enterprise) and I was back on a peak and back into a healthier state of mind with confidence reinstated, cracking on with CodeCreatedMe.
