Last Friday saw the first [Amazon UK Hackthon][1] take place in Glasgow University. With a top prize of $1000 of AWS credit on offer over 50 of Glasgows most talented CS students were in attendance.

I formed a team with two very talented University of Strathclyde Computer Science students, [Daniel Reilly][2] from first year and [Chris Sloey][3] from fourth year. Our idea was to create a shopping list for your travels. You input your destination and when you&#8217;re going and we return a list of things you&#8217;re going to need, so say your heading to Glasgow in July we&#8217;ll let you know you&#8217;re going to need an umbrella.

The team had a stack of knowledge and experience in Java, PHP, Ruby, Javascript with a touch of Objective-C. However we figured we were there to learn so we may as well be adventurous and try something new so we decided to build our hack with a language we had never used before so we went with Python. We set out to develop an API and from there we would build a mobile app and with time permitting a web front end.

With such an adventurous target we set out working the lean way &#8211; fail fast! We initially intended on using the go-to Python framework Django however we ran into a few problems and found the learning curve a tad too steep and with time against us we had a pivot and used the microframework [Flask][4]. We powered on made great progress and were ready to deploy, all attendees were given $50 AWS credit which would allow us to use EC2 but as feature packed as EC2 is we found it too time consuming getting set up and since we were using a git repository anyway we went with Heroku for hosting. Then we moved onto the front end, again the easy route was to do a web app but we wanted a bit of a challenge and decided to develop a mobile app, the outcome was [Travel Bit][5] for iOS.

After a night of lean working we pitched to a panel of &#8216;Amazonians&#8217; along with the other teams. Hacks that caught my eye include an awesome implementation of voice control for the Amazon store via the browser by [Mark Provan][6] (and his team the [Bogus Gasmen][7]) and winner of the People&#8217;s Choice Award a [crowd sourced tool for decision making][8] by Giraffa Cakes. Whilst we didn&#8217;t win me and the guys are well chuffed with how we worked as a team and what we achieved. We hope to work on Travel Bit a bit more and hopefully launch it in the coming weeks.

Big thank you to Glasgow University for hosting and to the [Edinburgh Amazon Development Centre][9] for putting it on, hopefully see a lot more Amazon Hackathons across Scotland in the future.

*If you missed out on the Amazon Hackathon remember [Startup Weekend Glasgow][10] is coming up on May 25th-27th with [£30 early bird tickets now available][11].
