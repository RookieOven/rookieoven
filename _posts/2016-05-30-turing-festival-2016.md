Event wise in the Scottish tech  community two events stand out, EIE which was at the start of May and [Turing Festival](http://turingfestival.com/?utm_source=RookieOven&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Early%20Bird#2016) which is on again this year in August. The two day conference has a focus on Product/People on day one and the return of Full Stack Marketing on the second day. The Turing Festival pulls in speakers from around the world and is insanely affordable at Â£149+VAT for an early bird two day ticket.
