Taking place on Monday 3rd of September in our new home, Vespbar, from half 6 onwards.

Vespbar is a short walk from both Glasgow Central and Queen Street Stations. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre, yip the freaking metre. We will be in the downstairs section but any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_MDHayes][1]) or the [RookieOven twitter][2] account. If you sign up to the Vespbar mailing list you can also get yourself a free pizza.

August has been a busy month in the  Scottish tech scene, Turing Festival and Dare Proto Play were obvious stand outs. They drew huge crowds and attracted some amazing speakers to Scotland.  Aside from large events we also had a bunch of great news elsewhere; TechMeetup has expanded to Inverness and Dundee, Glasgow held the first Glasgow JS meetup and there were a few product launches with [Seeu.at][3] and [Plantedd][4] to name a few.

Before the RookieOven meetup there is an open co-working event going on in the same location. Free to attend and starting at half 12 it&#8217;s another way people can mingle with local talents and hopefully generate some collaboration. For more information check out the [Eventbright][5] page.

With many startups progressing and growing September will be another busy month, let&#8217;s kick off by getting together to share idea&#8217;s, experience and knowledge. Will you be joining us?
