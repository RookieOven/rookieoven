Been rather busy of late, University, Startup Weekend Glasgow and a few other things in the works have meant I&#8217;ve not had the time to add content to RookieOven. So I thought it would be a good idea to share some cool events coming up in the weeks ahead:

  * [Think Business with Biggart Bailie][1]: free event to discuss a variety of issues facing new and established businesses in the current market. There will be lawyers on-hand to talk about business matters including intellectual property, employment, doing business on-line, debt recovery, structuring your business, leasing or buying property, negotiating with the bank, finance and litigation. Hosts Damien Bechelli and Chris McLeish, Partners in the Biggart Baillie Corporate and Property departments plus other experts, will be on hand to discuss your specific questions or concerns with you on a one-to-one basis.
  * [Engage Invest Exploit 12][2]: I&#8217;ve already sung the praises of EIE a few weeks back but it really is an excellent event. It is an annual showcase of high-quality companies spinning out of Scotland’s world leading Informatics and Computer Science departments and startup companies in our wider entrepreneurial ecosystem. Taking place on the 10th May in the Informatics Forum in Edinburgh, Jackie Stewart is the keynote speaker of the event. Impressive list of exhibitors such as Seeu.at, RecommendedBy, Float App and Insight Arcade.
  * [RookieOven Meetup][3]: yip it&#8217;s that time of the month again. RookieOven meetup will again be taking place first Monday of the month in Glasgow. From half 6 onwards come along to the Bier Halle Hippo Lounge on Sauchiehall Street. Chat with other founders and enthusiasts over a few beers and some free pizza.
  * [Startup Weekend Glasgow][4]: The first Startup Weekend to take place in Scotland is at the end of the month (25th-27th). Excellent opportunity to meet fellow startup enthusiasts, pitch a new idea, work on an MVP and see where things go. Tickets are available from the [Eventbrite page][5] and cost £40.

Any other events coming up you think startups should know about? I&#8217;m always looking for great events not only to attend but to add to the [Scottish StartupDigest][6] which is a free weekly mailing list highlighting the best events going on across Scotland.
