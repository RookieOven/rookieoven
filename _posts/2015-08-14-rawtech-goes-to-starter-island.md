One of my hopes for the RookieOven blog going forward will be to share updates on companies in the coworking space. So with that in mind here's a quick bit of news for Rawtech: founder, [Aaron Bassett](http://twitter.com/aaronbassett), has been selected to participate in the inaugural Starter Island. In the Bahamas.

##Starter Island

Taking place on 21st to the 28th of August throughout the Islands of The Bahamas, Starter Island will involve 4 teams working on ideas with the aim of building a product while on the beautiful schooner - Beacon Won.

Teams will be have a mix of local and international entrepreneurs and will compete against each other to build the best company and product.  During the five days each team will work in conditions that foster both creativity and ingenuity and by the time they get back to the capital they will pitch what theyâ€™ve worked on in front of an audience and judges for a grand prize.

##In Training Mode

Aaron isn't taking things lightly. A constant in the RookieOven office over the past 6 weeks has been a variety of boxes from Amazon - snorkel, water proof speakers, rugged hard drives, GoPro mounts and a load of other gadgets primed for Starter Island.

A spark of genious on Aaron's behalf, he has used a Raspberry Pi to create a local PyPI and NPM repository with a tonne of popular libraries and documentation loaded onto it then connected a small touchscreen to display the IP and connection details.

##A huge opportunity for Rawtech


##Keeping an eye on things

Aaron will be on social media and sharing his trip on his personal Instagram and Twitter accounts as well as on the Rawtech Twitter account.

If we're lucky he might do some video pieces with his GoPro.
