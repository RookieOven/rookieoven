Each Friday Startup Spotlight features a Scottish startup, giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. The aim is to, as the name suggest, put the spotlight on Scotland’s best startups. This week Edinburgh based [Musemantik][1].

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2021" title="musemantik-logo" src="http://www.rookieoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/musemantik-logo2.png" alt="Musemantik Logo" width="540" height="324" />][2]

The team behind Musemantik are Maciej Zurawski, Founder and CEO, Ronen Barzel, CTO and Diwakar Thakore, COO and co-founder. Musemantik was grown out of the EPIS Incubator in Edinburgh in 2009 and  was formally founded in December of that year.

Since 2009 Musemantik has been funded through a SMART award and some other grants, by a Silicon Valley business angel and with investment from friends and family from all over the world.

Musemantik are the creators of the online music creation service MusicFlow. Currently in beta, it is the first cloud-based music creation service in the world where anyone can create a track for their movie, video, photo slideshow, trailer or game, by controlling the length and the emotion of the music, so that it fits perfectly. The foundation for MusicFlow was Maciej&#8217;s personal interest in computer science, AI, music composition and the emotional impact of music.

The guys have created a walkthrough video which has an awesome example of MusicFlow set to an underwater tour.

Anyone can try out MusicFlow for free. Musemantik only charge for every download of a customised track, either a personal license ($0.79 for 4 minutes of music) or commercial license ($7.90 for 4 minutes of music) then for every sold track Musemantik pay the original composer a royalty on sales.

The guys have some great updates in the pipeline that will improve the service further so definitely one to watch.
