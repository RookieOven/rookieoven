The next RookieOven Meetup, and last of 2012, is taking place in Glasgow this coming Monday, 3rd or December. The RookieOven December Meetup will be attended by some of Scotland’s most promising tech startups and is a fantastic opportunity to meet like minded folk and discuss startups with your peers.

The venue for the RookieOven meetup is Vespbar which is a short walk from either Glasgow Central or Queen Street Station. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre. We will be in the downstairs section but any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_MDHayes][2]) or the [RookieOven twitter][3] account.

The meetup is a platform for the Scottish startup community to interact on a regular basis. At the meetup there are no talks, presentations or set agendas just great conversations between Scottish startup founders, employees and enthusiasts. There are only two rules for the meetup:

  * **No sales:** this isn’t an opportunity to sell to startups
  * **No stealth mode:** Talk! Share your idea’s and experiences with fellow Scottish startups

November was a busy month in the Scottish tech community. In regards to events there was [Startup Summit][4] and [Startup Weekend Edinburgh][5] just days apart in the middle of the month. Many startups launched new features or versions such as WallaBee, Seeu.at and FreeAgent and [TechCube][6] unveiled their website and an excellent video overview of the Edinburgh startup community. So plenty to discuss and evaluate over a drink and some pizza.

For the final meetup of 2012 I hope we not only reflect upon the prior month but also the whole year. The likes of EIE12, Startup Weekend Glasgow and the Turing Festival have provided first rate events for our community and [OpenTechCalendar][7] and the [Scottish StartupDigest][8] are great resources for keeping tabs on such events. We&#8217;ve [seen exits][9], [plenty of launches][10], [exciting startups emerging][11] and [a fair few talking points throughout the year][12]. All round it&#8217;s been a positive year for Scottish startups but one that I feel is really laying the ground work for what will be a humongous year in 2013.

More immediately looking ahead to December we have the Edinburgh Startups Christmas Party/TechCube Launch party on [Thursday the 13th December][13], TechMeetups, the return of [Girl Geeks Scotland][14] and I&#8217;m sure plenty more fantastic events that I hope to be able to attend plus there&#8217;s plenty time left in 2012 for more startups to launch and start generating revenue.

See you all on Monday.
