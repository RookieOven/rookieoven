The next RookieOven Meetup is taking place in Glasgow this coming Monday, 5th of November. The RookieOven November Meetup will be attended by some of Scotland&#8217;s most promising tech startups and is a fantastic opportunity to meet like minded folk and discuss startups with your peers.

The venue for the RookieOven meetup is Vespbar which is a short walk from either Glasgow Central or Queen Street Station. It has a great selection of beers and they do pizza by the metre. We will be in the downstairs section but any problems finding the venue on the night tweet me ([@_MDHayes][2]) or the [RookieOven twitter][3] account.

The meetup is a platform for the Scottish startup community to interact on a regular basis. At the meetup there are no talks, presentations or set agendas just great conversations between Scottish startup founders, employees and enthusiasts. There are only two rules for the meetup:

  * **No sales:** this isn’t an opportunity to sell to startups
  * **No stealth mode:** Talk! Share your idea’s and experiences with fellow Scottish startups

This month we will have special guests at RookieOven; Doug Ward and Shaun Gibson, founders of TechBritain and TechHub Manchester. The guys have been touring the UK with the aim of connecting and chronicling the various tech communities across the nation.

We will also have plenty to discuss as October has been a busy month on RookieOven and across the Scottish community. RookieOven attended the Dublin Web Summit along with some [awesome Scottish startups][4]. At the Web Summit we met startups from across the world such as of [Gogobot][5], [FluidU][6] and [Eventbrite][7]. We also heard what investors think will be [the next big thing][8]. Then Gregg O&#8217;Malley travelled to California to attend [YCombinator Startup School 2012][9], his thoughts from the event are well worth reading up on.

November looks to be yet another exciting month for Scottish tech startups. We have [Startup Summit][10] and [Startup Weekend Edinburgh][11] to look forward to in Edinburgh and the usual mix of meetups and user groups getting together across the country. What better way to kick the month off than to come together for a few drinks in Vespbar?
