Education is having a hard time keeping up to speed with the fast moving world of tech. In the tech industry there's not a day goes by there isn't a new Javascript framework or a new design language or new device launched. Contrast that with Scottish schools where languages like Basic are the norm and digital marketing is an after thought. That's why in March we announced the [RookieOven Academy](https://rookieoven.com/2016/03/31/launching-our-academy). The RookieOven community is made up of amazing talent that works at the forefront of technology and digital innovation. Using our community we're giving young people an unparalleled opportunity to learn from leaders of the Scottish tech

##Format

Over the course of the Academy participant will team up and develop a product/business concept over the six two hour sessions. Each of the six session will have a particular theme and an 'inspiration speaker'.

##Day One Speaker - Chris Sloey
Our first session kicked off with Chris Sloey, cofounder of Add Jam, helping us understand how to come up with idea's for real, useful products that people would use and pay for. Add Jam create software products on mobile (iOS and Android) and the web for clients around the world and launch their own products so this is something they do often. Chris shared insight from the front line of creating high quality software products. Top tips from Chris include:

* Start with a problem.
* Embrace your hobbies and interests. You have such good knowledge of your own hobbies that you should be able to identify problems plus you'll have an interest/passion for it which will make it more worthwhile to work on it.
* Start simple. You don't need to spend weeks and months developing a grand product, start small and build it up over time.
* Get feedback. Speak to everyone about your product and get invaluable feedback early on.
* Seek advice. Use knowledge of others to fill gaps you might have or to get a steer when you're unsure about things.
* Experiment. Try things out and if it doesn't work that's ok because failing is good. Failing is often the best way to learn.

So now that Chris had given us some ideas from the inside of Add Jam and how they work and develop idea's we applied that through some short exercises.

##Exercises
First thing we did as a group was to warm up our creative muscles. We did a couple of short challenges to help us do this. First up in 60 second we all had to name as many uses as possible for everyday items. Like a pencil, you can use it to write with and you can chew them but what else could they good for?

We had some really varied uses like a weapon, transporting things, building a tower or a part of a sling shot. All from something we usually just use for writing with. We did this a few times (and even tried it using colour to mix it up). Each time we were getting more creative and more relaxed to think outside the box.

With us all thinking more creatively we moved onto the next challenge. We teamed up, were given three totally random words and 10 minute time limit to come up with a product that we would pitch to the group. Groups had words like urban starship laboratory and hot source whitespace.

And the groups delivered. Drones that pick up litter around cities, engaging app's that help people study  to tourist information apps that have tight filters the groups came up with some amazingly diverse and really practical ideas.

##Pitching and teaming up
At that our pizza's arrived and we relaxed, got to know each other a bit better and talked over idea's and interested. After we were all well fed everyone had the opportunity to pitch a product idea. For those that didn't have a business idea that was ok, they listened to those that did and would team up with their favourite. For those pitching and idea it was their job to recruit a team to work on their idea.

This worked well and we have three teams and three excellent idea's:

* Visual to-do list - a lot of people remember things through things like smell, sound and what they see. This team are looking into ways to help people remember things through visual representation of tasks all in a mobile app.
* Simple Animations - everyone is creative. But digital tools for being creative are either complex, expensive or underpowered. This team want to make a web based tool to empower people to make high quality animations and distribute them online.
* Tourist Information - there's so much noise on the internet. It's difficult to get the information that *you* want especially when travelling. This group want to make it easy to filter attractions and facilities by theme, culture and the strengths of each attraction so you can get the best experience possible in cities you visit.

##What's next
Over the next week all the teams will be having a think about their idea, talking to people for feedback, getting advice and iterating on what they're doing. Next week Rohan Gunatillake from Mindfulness Everywhere will be on hand to share his experience and an overview of the products he's made like [Buddhify](http://buddhify.com) on iOS and Android, [Cards for Mindfulness](http://www.mindfulnesseverywhere.io/cards/) a successful Kickstarter campaign, his book [This is Happening](https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Happening-Redesigning-mindfulness-modern/dp/1509803122?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) and [Sleepfulness App](http://www.sleepfulnessapp.com) on iOS and Android.
