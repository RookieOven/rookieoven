**The plans for the December 5th meetup have changed. Please see the post [Slight Change of Plan &#8211; Sorry][1] for more details.**

The RookieOven meetup has been running for a while now (since June actually &#8211; time flies) and speaking for myself I&#8217;ve gotten a lot out of it and met so many like minded people. Up until now the Bier Hall has been the venue and the free pizzas have went down a treat but with the December meetup being the last of 2011 I thought it would be fun to do something a little different for Christmas.

The meetup in December will again be the first Monday of the month (5th) but it&#8217;s going to be held in the new Entrepreneurial Spark space and have a little twist. In a few posts recently I&#8217;ve been talking about [answering hard questions][2] and [getting your idea out][3] and the meetup this month is the perfect opportunity to do it &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be a small pitching competition.

Well when I say competition it&#8217;s really more just a bit of fun but pitching will allow people to get comfortable speaking about their idea&#8217;s plus it&#8217;s always good to practice speaking in front of a crowd (and you&#8217;re as well doing that in a friendly environment). This meetup will also allow everyone to have a look at the Entrepreneurial Spark office area and founder Jim Duffy will be there to share his vision for Entrepreneurial Spark. Entrepreneurial Spark may not be for you but I think its important to know what&#8217;s on your doorstep and to know the kind of startups that are in the same city as you.

So I&#8217;m looking for people willing to pitch, nothing too large or in depth. I&#8217;m thinking a maximum of four slides along the lines of:

  * Team &#8211; who is behind this idea and why is this team going to make an amazing product
  * Product &#8211; what is it the team is making
  * Plans &#8211; when, where&#8217;s and what&#8217;s of your startups
  * Where you&#8217;re at &#8211; as it stands what have you got

The meetup will start at the usual time of half 6 and there will be free pizza (courtesy of Jim Duffy) and although we wont be able to have any beer in the Entrepreneurial Spark building there is a high probability of a visit to a pub afterwards. For those that haven&#8217;t been already the Entrepreneurial Spark office is based in Caledonia House on the south side of the river:

Attending previous meetups we&#8217;ve had a fantastic mix of people from folk with successful businesses to those who only have an excellent idea and I hope both types would be willing to take part on the 5th. If you&#8217;d like to pitch email me (<mdhayes@gmx.com>) and I would also appreciate if your planning on coming to let me know so we have an idea of numbers for the night but as always no need to book a ticket.

So tell me, think it sounds good?
