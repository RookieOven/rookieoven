As Rebecca Black would say &#8220;it&#8217;s Friday Friday Friday&#8221; so perfect time to get a movie for yourself to watch. With the events of this week I would suggest watching Pirates of Silicon Valley.

Made in the late 90&#8242;s the film tells the stories of both Apple and Microsoft from the early 70&#8242;s up to the point the film was made. The birth and early life of two of the biggest companies in the world today is a fantastic story. I also find it fascinating watching it today as the film was made at a time when Microsoft was riding high with Windows and Apple was on the cusp of collapse.

As you might be able to tell from the trailer above the film was made for TV so don&#8217;t expect The Social Network levels of polish and writing. Saying that the film stars Noah Wyle from ER as Steve Jobs and the voice of Bender John DiMaggio as Steve Ballmer who are pretty good calls for casting.

As far as I know the film isn&#8217;t on iTunes (or any other place you can download it legally) but if you don&#8217;t mind watching the film split into parts and not in 1080p it is on YouTube.
