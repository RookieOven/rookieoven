We all work hard. From the startups in Glasgow to the giant organisations and even the public sector so let's get together, play some video games and doing a bit of light networking. Press Start is a new regular meetup in Glasgow aiming to do just that and the first event is coming up on the 21st of April.

##What to expect

The first Press Start on the 21st of April and will feature:

* The Glasgow Startups Pool Championship
* Casual Table Tennis
* Card games (Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens etc)
* Retro Video Games - SNES, N64
* Mario Kart on the WiiU
* VR Fun with Oculus and Google Cardboard

If you have a cool game or a piece of retro goodness feel free to bring that along too.

The event is non-profit and all equipment and games have been donated. Entry Price is £4 via Eventbrite this covers the cost of beer & pizza. Attendees can choose to donate £1 or £2 that will be used to buy more games and consoles for future events or if you have any old games you don't want, donations would be greatly appreciated.
