Earlier this year I highlighted some top events taking place across Scotland and it seemed to go down pretty well so I figured worth highlighting what Scottish startup and tech events are coming up in the closing weeks of 2013.

## [Startup Summit 2013][1]

Date: 20th November

Returning to Edinburgh for its second running and once again taking place during Global Entreprenuer Week, Startup Summit is the UK&#8217;s largest national, not-for-profit event for entrepreneurs. It features a varied, interactive, day-long schedule: inspiring speakers, workshops, presentations, network opportunities. The venue is Edinburgh&#8217;s prestigious Assembly Rooms and as of writing there a few hours left to secure your ticket.  
Around 500 young entrepreneurs will attend. They&#8217;ll hear from a wide range of inspiring expert speakers but who share one attribute: massive business success. Their fields include marketing, retail, technology, food, film and media, recruitment, and entertainment.

## [Life&#8217;s a Pitch Bill Joos][3]

Date: 20th November (Glasgow) 21st November (Edinburgh)

Just go book your place on one of these workshops immediately. Excellent workshop with a former sales executive and ex-VC who knows what the perfect deck should contain and how you should be delivering it. Bill Joos has been running these workshops with Informatics Ventures for several years and the quality is consistently high.

There are main workshop sessions in both Glasgow and Edinburgh and likewise a smaller taster session in the evening in both cities.

## [STV Tech Talks][4]

Date: 22nd November

The 4th STV Tech Talks focuses on Javascript with Phil Leggeter talking Building front-end JavaScript apps that scale and Stuart Memo talking The Amazing Sounds of JavaScript. There will be free beer and pizza and a chance to meet/network with other developers.

## [RookieOven Edinburgh][5]

Date: 2nd December

To my shame we&#8217;ve never ran a RookieOven Meetup in Edinburgh but I&#8217;m pleased to announce we will be having out first Edinburgh Meetup on the 2nd of December. Huge thanks to Allan Lloyds of Insight Arcade/Startup Digest and Callum Stuart of Mallzee for helping get the Edinburgh Meetup off the ground. The Meetup will follow the same format as the Glasgow Meetup. Grab a beer and chat with your peers following only two simple rules. No Sales! No Stealth!

## Startup Christmas Parties

There will almost certainly be another excellent Edinburgh Startups Christmas Party and if there&#8217;s interest (this is where I would appreciate your feedback, or if you&#8217;re in a position to your support) there is also likely to be  a Glasgow Startup Christmas Party. Dates and venues to be confirmed but will be sharing on this site and on our [Facebook][7] and [Twitter][8] when we find out.

**Anything I&#8217;ve missed out? Let me know in the comments or tweet RookieOven and it can be added in.**
