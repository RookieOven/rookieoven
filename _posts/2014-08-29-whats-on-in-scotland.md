Been quiet on here (sorry about that but life and business get in the way) but thought it would be worth while and useful to do a quick rounding up of some great events that are happening over the coming weeks in Scotland. First up one up is on this weekend in Glasgow.

### The Whisky Bond Summer Party

When: Saturday 30th August 2pm onwards  
Cost: Free

I think we can get away with still saying it&#8217;s summer. The Whisky Bond is quickly establishing itself as a hub for arts and creatives but they are also engaging the tech community. The building is already home to Dynamically Loaded and IC Mobile Lab and at the Summer Party they have a few tech focused workshops through the day such as a session on soldering with the Arduino and a session called Contribute which aims to get people contributing to Open Source projects.

### Ignite Office Hours

Paul Smith [(@paul\_a\_smith)][5] from the Ignite Accelerator in Newcastle is coming to Glasgow to run an office hours session through the afternoon on the 5th of September. Limited spaces available but free, you just need to book a slot on the Doodle. Great opportunity to get a grilling and advice from Paul.

### Product Forge September

Product Forge weekends are an opportunity for you to develop your career through practical experience. The events brings together entrepreneurially minded designers, developers and product managers. Participants form small cross-functional teams who work on a product concept over a weekend. Anyone is free to pitch an idea and everyone receives mentoring, meals and 24 hour access to the venue.

Also remember the September RookieOven Meetup is this Monday, 1st of September, in Arches Cafe from 6.30. We&#8217;ll be on the top floor on the couches as usual.
