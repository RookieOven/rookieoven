##Adimo Success
Glasgow, UK – 21st February 2017: Marketing tech start-up Adimo has closed a £1m seed financing round following early traction with major consumer packaged goods companies (CPGs) including Nestlé and PepsiCo. The Glasgow headquartered company, whose software natively embeds shopping functionality into digital marketing campaigns and content, will use the funding to expand its commercial team and drive customer acquisition. Investors include Scottish Investment Bank (the investment arm of Scottish Enterprise), ESM Investments, Galvanise Capital and Patrick Griffith, co-founder and ex-CEO of Havas Work Club.

Richard Kelly, who previously worked in digital advertising, founded Adimo in 2012 having recognised that despite investing large sums on marketing, the CPG (consumer packaged goods) industry lacked the ability to acquire customers directly and as a consequence had limited customer data or insights. CTO Colin Brown devised a way to forklift the basket addition process into digital marketing campaigns and content.

“CPGs see data as the key driver of growth and competitiveness but despite spending billions on awareness campaigns they’re getting very little back in terms of data. This makes marketing optimisation extremely difficult,” comments Richard Kelly, founder and CEO at Adimo. “Our technology integrates with any form of marketing to make it shoppable, shortening the path to purchase, putting brands in baskets and providing valuable behavioural data about customer decision-making for to clients.”

Adimo’s platform integrates with any form of marketing – including display ads, landing pages, websites, social media and video - to make it shoppable. Thanks to Adimo’s integrations with retailers, shoppers simply select products and add them directly to their online supermarket basket for later purchase with the rest of their weekly shop.

Furthermore, purchased products are automatically added to the shoppers ‘favourites’ list, greatly increasing the chance of repeat purchase – up to 70% of items bought from online supermarkets are from favourites lists.

Crucially, Adimo gives brands valuable behavioural data about customer decision-making. Its real-time analytics dashboard offers a comprehensive range of insights including products viewed, basket additions and revenue, which can in turn be linked to marketing source. This brings previously unavailable ecommerce-level insight to awareness-based marketing.

Adimo is available on either a license or CPM fee. Its customers include consumer goods behemoths Nestle, P&G and PepsiCo. The company has already added over 1,000,000 products to baskets for its clients, generating incremental revenue of over £14million. The technology is now integrated with over 100 retailers across 20 countries and any retailer can be added on request.

“FMCG companies are increasingly looking at how to maximise Digital Marketing spend and understand sales impact of the reach or engagement that our brand marketing makes” comments Sean Douglas at PepsiCo. “We believe Adimo is a radical and highly compelling solution that allows frictionless path to purchase. The technology solution makes for a seamless integration and we’ve been very encouraged with the results following our initial trials. The partnership with Adimo has been one where we work together to create a solution that works for both the shopper and our brands. I believe Adimo with PepsiCo are setting the standard of Media to Shelf in the FMCG digital marketing industry.”

“The channel ecosystem is enormous but highly siloed – the fact remains that for shoppers, buying FMCG goods on impulse is convoluted,” continues Richard Kelly, founder and CEO at Adimo. “Given our touchpoints with consumers, brands and retailers, we believe there is a big opportunity for to use our technology to not just help brands sell more effectively, but to do so in ways that makes shopper's lives easier.”

“Since the discovery of Data, too many Marketing tech firms have all but abandoned the noble art of creative seduction for a new drug called low-cost targeting, and it is the consumer who loses out,” comments Patrick Griffith, co-founder and ex-CEO of Havas Work Club. “I like that Adimo are asking a different question, and while most marketing tech firms seem to focus on ever more ingenious ways of shafting the consumer, Adimo's idea of "How can we make advertising more useful to people?” is really refreshing.”

“For our FMCG clients, this has opened up digital advertising in a whole new way; providing the insight that was so desperately needed to justify spending online. To see Adimo secure additional funding is very exciting and we wish them success with bringing this product to a wider market,” comments Matt Lee, Co-founder and Director of shopper media agency, Capture.

“The Adimo business is extremely exciting given the scale of the market opportunity and the quality of the brands the company is already working with”, said Kerry Sharp, Head of Scottish Investment Bank. “We are delighted to be able to support the company’s growth plans by participating in this funding round in addition to the other support Scottish Enterprise has provided to the company.”
