This past week has to be one of the busiest yet in Glasgow for tech folk. Last Monday we had the [UX Book Club][1], then on Tuesday the first ever [PopupHack][2] and on Wednesday [Lean Agile Glasgow][3]. Great to see so much activity in the local community and the good news is it&#8217;s set to continue.

This week there is Refresh Glasgow, a monthly meetup for wed developers and designers which takes place on the third Wednesday of each month. Not too dissimilar to the monthly RookieOven meetup in atmosphere, likeminded people get together and enjoy a few beers. This Wednesday the venue is a relatively new bar in Glasgow called Vespbar, on Drury Street.

Good range of beers and selling pizza by the metre it&#8217;s easy to see the attraction for a tech event plus if you sign up for the newsletter you get a voucher for a free pizza. Sign up is via [the homepage][4]. I can highly recommend going, it&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to meet Glasgow&#8217;s most talented web developers and designers.

Another new regular event in Glasgow is [GlasgowJS][5]. The first GlasgowJS meetup will be on the 7th of August in as yet undetermined location and will be kicking off at half 6. GlasgowJS wont be all talks and presentations; the organiser plan to include hack sessions, katas over the meetups. Speaking at the first GlasgowJS will be Paul Cowan, his talk will be no slides all code.

I do like to see so much activity in Glasgow and it&#8217;s something that I see reflected in other areas of the country. The likes of [TwitAyr][6] and the announced [TechUp Inverness][7] are awesome to see. To make sure you don&#8217;t miss anything I would suggest:

  * Bookmarking both [http://glasgow2.com][8] and [http://edinburgh2.com][9] to know what&#8217;s going on in each city
  * Sign up to the [TechMeetup Google Group][10] and the [Scottish StartupDigest][11] (which I curate), for email updates. In the case of the StartupDigest this is once a week on a Monday morning
  * And of course keep an eye on RookieOven

Will I be seeing you at [Refresh Glasgow][12] on Wednesday?
