Seedcamp aims to bring together 20 of the best early stage tech startups from all over the world and expose them to top entrepreneurs, investors and developers to participate in a day of intense mentoring and networking.

Seedcamp offers a lot to early stage startups besides investment, they become members of the Seedcamp family which is a huge peer network and benefit from the founder’s pack worth over €100k with the lately added Amazon Web Services credits. Seedcamp London is the last chance to be part of Seedcamp Week 2012, Seedcamps annual flagship event, immersing our teams into an incredible pool of mentors during an intense week, topped by a huge Demo day.

For a taste of what to expect check out this video from the Demo day of Seedcamp Week 2011:
