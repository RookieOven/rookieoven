Another busy week for me and the guys. As I pointed out in my [last post][1] there has to be change in the Scottish startup scene, we need to create a community and I think this week we have started to lay the foundation for change.

On Monday myself and Chris were talking to a local successful entrepreneur who is desperate to see change happening in Glasgow. He has a vision to help and support fledgling startups. This is hopefully going to be a game changer, so more on that as the project develops.

Me and the guys shared a pint and some delicious pizza with the Social Penguin himself Mike McGrail and got some great feedback about our first service we are currently building. We have been asked to provide some guest posts to The Social Penguin Blog about startups. One of the team has actually contributed to The Social Penguin Blog already with a post on [Humanising Your Startup Through Social Media][2] by Chris posted yesterday.

This week me and the guys also had another wee trip over to the capital. On Friday we went over to the [Start Up Café 2nd birthday party][3] where firstly there was a free bar and secondly there was a whole host of talented tech folk. Was great to meet again some of the faces for EIE11 the previous week but was also brilliant to meet the Startup Cafe crew. They are doing a hell of a lot of good work and are looking to expand their reach over into Glasgow. Very exciting!

This week has been a good week for creating a better startup community across the whole of Scotland but also we have made some real headway with our first product. We hope to very shortly (as in within the next two weeks) launch our first service into alpha testing and we are going to need some tester. If your interested in helping out leave a comment or tweet me or one of the guys. Would greatly appreciate all helpers.
