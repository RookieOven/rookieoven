Dig out that Christmas jumper, dust off your Santa hat and get ready for some seasonal cheer… It’s the **Glasgow Tech Christmas Party**!

Back for the 3rd year running, the event brings together developers and designers, creatives and disruptors, and all the other wonderful people that help make the tech community in Glasgow what it is.
Come along to **The Raven** on **Wednesday 7th December** for some holiday spirit, delicious bites, good company and general merriment.

Tickets are just __[£10 + eventbrite fees](https://gla-xmas-tech.eventbrite.com/?aff=rookieoven)__.

>>_As someone who has been to the last two Tech Christmas parties I have to say it is a real highlight of the year, I always meet people that I have not seen in ages, and new interesting people I would not have met otherwise. You are SERIOUSLY missing out if you don’t go. Buy a ticket!_

>>_- Kevin Brolly, [Braw Software](http://www.thisisbraw.co.uk/)_

The event is completely volunteer-organised and the ticket money goes towards the cost of the venue, food, etc. Anything left at the end of the night will be donated to this year’s chosen charity, the Mental Health Foundation.

We also want to say a huge thank you to all of this year’s sponsors, who help us to put on this great event!
