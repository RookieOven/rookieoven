A new regular feature on RookieOven will be Startup Spotlight. Each Friday a Scottish startup will be highlight giving a brief overview of the company, what they do, where they are and who they are. The aim is to, as the name suggest, put the spotlight on Scotland&#8217;s best startups. First up, [GatherContent][1].

Based in the city centre of Aberdeen; GatherContent has been founded by [James Deer][3] and his team (Managing Director Alice, Engineer Peter and Product Manager Angus).

GatherContent aim to become 37Signals Basecamp meets Google Docs with structure. GatherContent uses a SaaS business model using monthly subscriptions which are based on the number of active projects a user has. Monthly subscriptions start at $24 rising to $99.

Here&#8217;s a two minute video the team have made to describe the product:



GatherContent was started just over a year ago as a side project to solve the problem of &#8216;email tennis&#8217; James was facing in his previous business Deer Digital.  Thus far GatherContent has been self funded and James says they hope to hold off seeking investment until they have grown the company with the resources available.

Just launched and already covered in [TechCrunch][4] it&#8217;s great to see Scottish tech startups doing well!
