2014 had been a big year for me personally (thinking of posting a &#8216;Year in Review&#8217; type post in the next few weeks) and I know a lot has been happening across the Scottish tech community in 2o14. Raising money, exits and lots of new products launching. What&#8217;s going on in December to bring it all to a close?

### Glasgow Tech Christmas Party

Folks behind Refresh, TechMeetup, RookieOven and a few of the local user groups are putting their heads together to bring Glasgow tech together for a Christmas do. Nothing too fancy; some booze, some food and a bunch of good people. Taking place in The Raven on Renfield Street and starting at 7.30.
