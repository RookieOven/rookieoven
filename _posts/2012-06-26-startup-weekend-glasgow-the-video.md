Startup Weekend Glasgow at the end of May this year was the first Startup Weekend to take place in Scotland. It was a fantastic weekend which [I&#8217;ve written about before on RookieOven][1] but throughout the weekend a film crew from 29 Studios where on hand to capture the event.

The outcome is this fantastic video:

Great to finally see Startup Weekend happen in Scotland and hopefully it will be the first of many. Where in Scotland should hold the next Startup Weekend?
