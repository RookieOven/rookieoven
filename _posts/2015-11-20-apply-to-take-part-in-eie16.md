A must attend event on the Scottish tech/startup calendar is the annual EIE (Engage Invest Exploit) event organised by the folks at Informatics Ventures. The event in Edinburgh takes place around May time each year and brings together companies across the tech, life sciences and energy sectors to showcase their organisations in front of a mix of press, investors and the public sector.

Now in it’s ninth year, EIE has grown to be the largest investor technology showcase in the UK. EIE Scotland focuses on technology investment opportunities from companies headquartered in Scotland. With events like EIE Scotland is fast becoming one of Europe’s most vibrant tech scenes.

Previous events have been covered on RookieOven such as the [2012 event](http://rookieoven.com/2012/05/17/eie12-keynote-speaker-sir-jackie-stewart/) where the amazing Sir Jackie Stewart delivered the keynote. Next year there will certainly be a great lineup of speakers that will inspire and educate startups however the main draw of the event is the startups exhibiting their products. EIE pulls in a fantastic mix of companies from across the country. From hardware to web and mobile there's a lot to see and it always show's the ability of Scotland to produce world class products and services.

The EIE conference is the end point for companies exhibiting but their engagement with EIE starts much earlier with a series of workshops and bootcamps in the months leading up to the event. These include an excellent [one day pitch workshop](http://rookieoven.com/2012/02/09/long-is-easy-short-is-hard/) by 'Pitch Doctor' Bill Joos.
