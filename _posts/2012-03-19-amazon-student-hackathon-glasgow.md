Taking place in Glasgow University from 9am on the 3oth until 1pm on the 31st, this is the first UK Hackathon organised by Amazon. Open only to students it&#8217;s great to see a large company such as Amazon support the local community and encouraging students to get involved in events such as this.

Each team gets $50 of AWS credit to use and Amazonians from the Amazon Scotland Development Centre will be on hand for advice and support. The schedule for the day is:

  * Team Check-in 09:30 – 10:00 (Friday 30th March) – flexibility available for exam clashes etc.
  * Welcome! 10:00 &#8211; 10:30
  * Unconference 10:30 – 12:00
  * Hackathon 13:00 – 09:00 (overnight)
  * Breakfast 09:00 – 10:00 (Saturday 31st March)
  * Presentation & Judging 10:00 – 11:30
  * Prizes 11:30 – 13:00

This is event is only for students although if it&#8217;s a success I&#8217;m sure Amazon will organise more and large hack events in Scotland. Being a student at the moment it mean&#8217;s I can attend so will tweeting on the day and will report back on how it goes.

If you&#8217;re interested in going you can sign up at the [Amazon UK Hackathon meetup group][3].
