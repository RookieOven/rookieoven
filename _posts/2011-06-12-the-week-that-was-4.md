Started with the meetup on Monday which was a great success, lot of cool folk came along so looking forward to the next one in [July][2]. Lots of exciting things happening with Visume this week as well.

On Wednesday I went to the FatBuzz [New Media BBQ][3] at the Golf Lounge in Glasgow, the evening was based around bringing the Silicon Valey mindset to Scotland. Was a great night where I got to meet the teams from Attacat, FatBuzz, The BIG Partnership and meet Andrew McCalister of [HeyZap][4]. HeyZap are doing checkins for mobile games, kinda like a FourSquare but for games. Andrew is a Scot based in Silicon Valley and hearing his advice was invaluable. Andrew was very gracious and gave me and the guys more of his time on Friday and went through our plans for Visume and gave us a load of help.

On Thursday I actually spent a little bit of time developing an Android app I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for a while. Nothing too complex its a cool twist on the conventional weather app. Hope to get some time to finish it this week so will be looking for some testers, get in touch if your interested.

Thursday night me and Finbarr went to [Social Media Unleashed][5] in the Lighthouse. This was an event organised by the Twintangibles guys Tim and Daniella. These guys are also bringing [Social Media Week to Glasgow][6] in September which is a great accolade for the city and will help put us on the world stage.

In all a great week with lots happening. Looking forward to developing Visume in the weeks ahead, are you intrigued to know more about it?
